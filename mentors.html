<p><strong>NASA Openscapes Mentors have created “go-to” resources for staff and users using NASA Earthdata – such as the <code>earthaccess</code> python library and tutorials in the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook.</strong> Over the last four years, Mentors have developed these resources as a supportive community in response to teaching hundreds of NASA Earthdata users via workshops and events together, where they identify and rapidly respond to common needs then iterate through active use, documentation, and further teaching. Recent presentations showcasing this work is <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-TiPN8bfY6iDL5EVcEuCQSjqFMs3jPSX2MlNWA6no2E/edit#slide=id.g2eae202a90f_4_248">Supporting NASA Earthdata users in the Cloud: NASA Openscapes onboarding &amp; fledging</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D3C2_wBSHAPMNes0hLQHjaRuU_ifEzcKIvf3_H5rZGM/edit#slide=id.g269ad4ab477_0_691">earthaccess: how to accelerate user value through open, collaborative development</a>.</p>
<p>Openscapes is a mechanism that can rapidly identify problems and bring people together to solve them. The NASA Openscapes Mentor community includes people across NASA Earth science data centers (DAACs) that work together to deliver work aligned with DAAC goals to enable science, enriched by collaborating with the open science community beyond NASA.</p>
<section id="current-activities" class="level1">
<h1>Current Activities</h1>
<p>Building from successes and momentum 2021-2024, in 2025 NASA Openscapes will continue teaching users and developing solutions for pain points, while we all grow as open science leaders. This is vital work to support the shift to Earthdata Cloud and to NASA’s values for open science.</p>
<section id="goals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="goals">2025 goals</h2>
<p>Our 2025 focus is strengthening NASA networks between DAACs, missions, training programs, and applications, aligned with SPD-41a open science, as we continue to support users through developing skills and tools. 2025 goals were determined by Mentors during our Fall 2024 Mentors Retreat.</p>
<p>We will move forward on the following four interlinking goals. Below is a brief overview of the purpose, outcomes, and process of each, and how to join us.</p>
<section id="user-support-and-co-development" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="user-support-and-co-development">1. User support and co-development</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Supporting users in the Cloud, which requires infrastructure and skills. Skills include mindset shifts, as well as new technical and collaboration skills. Infrastructure requires co-developing software and resources as well as providing a JupyterHub compute space for developing tutorials and teaching workshops, which we do in partnership with <a href="https://2i2c.org/">2i2c</a>. The goal is to “make once, use often”, reusing materials and iterating and improving upon them as a distributed group of mentors who learn with, from, and for each other.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outcomes</strong>: Users have a friendly onboarding experience using NASA Earthdata in the cloud. Users develop good practices for sustained work in the cloud, including parallelizing code, managing storage, and understanding cloud costs and options for “fledging” from our workshop Hub.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Process</strong>: We lead well-planned, welcoming, user-designed teaching events in a variety of formats including in-person and online (hackathons, workshops, Champions Cohorts, Community Calls, conference sessions). To prepare for these events, we develop open documentation, slides, and tutorials that are available for reuse and remix; we host a JupyterHub compute space in partnership with 2i2c; we co-develop technical cloud technical infrastructure including scientific software docker images, user access administration, cost reports/tracking, and documentation of user stories. We develop together asynchronously and synchronously via hackdays and coworking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To join teaching events</strong>: Check our <a href="./news.html">News &amp; Events page</a> for registration, available in late summer.</li>
<li><strong>To join hackdays/coworking</strong>: Check our <a href="https://github.com/Openscapes/openscapes.cloud/discussions">Cloud infrastructure GitHub</a> to get involved in biweekly hackdays.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="earthaccess-python-library" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="earthaccess-python-library">2. <code>earthaccess</code> python library</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To continue growth and sustainability of this python library that is used by 100’s of projects and 1000’s of users for accessing NASA Earthdata programmatically. <code>earthaccess</code> simplifies data discovery and access to NASA Earthdata by providing an abstraction layer to NASA’s APIs for programmatic access (CMR and EDL). It has complements in R and MATLAB that we can develop further.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outcomes</strong>: More users can easily access NASA Earthdata. Increased community engagement via developing scaffolding to reduce participation barriers (education and outreach); Software sustainability and maintenance and further feature development including integrating VirtualiZarr, testing on Cloud OPeNDAP-enabled collections (DMR++ compliance/consistency), building a plugin interface for services like Harmony, developing a “Results” Class that will be interoperable with the STAC ecosystem, using <code>earthaccess</code> for download scripts from Earthdata Search, and developing a Command Line Interface (CLI).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Process</strong>: Community-driven and community-requested development, currently including contributors from multiple DAACs, NASA, and the open science community. We develop asynchronously as well as via biweekly hackdays. We also share progress and features via continued talks and events to support users and showcase capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To join</strong>: The <code>earthaccess</code> <a href="https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/">contributing guide</a> shares information about asynchronous contributions, joining biweekly hackdays, and the Zulip messaging board.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="champions-cohort-fall-2025" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="champions-cohort-fall-2025">3. Champions Cohort (Fall 2025)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To support users using NASA Earthdata in science workflows from multiple data centers, taught and supported by Mentors who get to understand user needs deeply and co-develop solutions. Potentially <code>earthaccess</code>-focused to support users programmatically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outcomes</strong>: Users learn skills for current best practices for using NASA Earthdata and are empowered to ask questions and work more collaboratively within and across teams. Users have more awareness of what is available, what is coming, and how to get involved as contributors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Process</strong>: This flagship Openscapes Champions program has been led 27 times since 2019, with 3 previous Cohorts co-led with NASA Mentors. We will lead this year’s Cohort in Fall 2025, giving time to align with ESDIS and NASA Earth Action’s goals and communities. As there is current instability in our user communities, we will focus the spring and summer on developing relationships with user groups and restructuring the Champions Cohorts to best meet user needs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To join</strong>: Check our <a href="./news.html">News &amp; Events page</a> for registration, available in late summer.</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="earthdata-cloud-cookbook" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="earthdata-cloud-cookbook">4. Earthdata Cloud Cookbook</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: A curated collection of tutorials and documentation that focus on the common steps across DAACs and users. It is available for self-paced learning with links back to the underlying GitHub repository where it is developed and able to be reused and remixed. It is under active, open development. We are reaching a lot of users with workshops and our compiled resources; how can we continue to improve those events and resources?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outcomes</strong>: A better-maintained resource that has contributors beyond the Mentors and a broadened set of users. What if we opened the scope beyond “cloud” and included other common Earthdata tutorials?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Process</strong>: Throughout all our user support, we trial materials with users that help us to update and improve the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook. Tutorials, presentations, and approaches are added to the Cookbook based on latest user needs and trends/tooling. For example, we are adding more support for R users, and we are reporting openly on compute and storage costs so that they could allot cloud funding into future proposals. Most Cookbook development is motivated by teaching events (workshops and hackathons and Champions).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To join</strong>: Check our <a href="https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/discussions">Cookbook GitHub Discussions</a>; in Spring 2025 we are starting biweekly hackdays to drive more continual development alongside event-driven development. We are excited to build momentum with Development Seed contributions from VEDA. We can also collaborate with ESDIS for sharing cloud resources on the unified site, answering questions like: Does it need to be cloud-specific? Can it just be Earthdata specific?</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-we-work">How we work</h2>
<p>Openscapes is about working effectively and openly as teams. We are user-focused and meet regularly to learn skills of immediate use together and to work on common needs for researchers using NASA Earthdata. We have an open science approach to resource development, where we focus on having space and place, sharing early and iterating with feedback, with a “make once, use often”, future us web-first mindset. Mentors build skills through Openscapes mentorship, co-developing events, software, and open practices and relationships with the open source community, with access to a JupyterHub that helps refine teaching strategies for Cloud.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="goals-1">2024 goals</h2>
<p>NASA Openscapes is the main access point for NASA Earth science &amp; tutorial development on the Cloud. Openscapes is not extra work, it’s the <strong>how</strong> of doing the work aligned with DAAC goals to enable users/science. Building from successes and momentum 2021-2023, in 2024 we will continue teaching staff &amp; researchers, helping us all grow as open science leaders &amp; aligned with DAAC activities. This is vital to the shift to Earthdata Cloud and to NASA’s values for open science.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide stability for and strengthen the DAAC Mentor community as we develop and teach a common set of tutorials and coordinate and lead learning events, in part through our twice monthly Openscapes Cohort Calls.</li>
<li>Reuse and refine shared teaching resources, share stories and lessons learned at conferences and meetups</li>
<li>Lead events together (workshops and Champions cohort) with research teams, with Mentors assisting to support researchers and learn new modalities of support</li>
<li>Support transition for NASA Earthdata users to the Cloud via continued effort to maintain development for cloud infrastructure &amp; earthaccess Python library, Earthdata Cloud Cookbook &amp; Cheatsheets, give talks, tie-in better with NASA Earthdata website, and cross-learning with NOAA and other Openscapes Mentors &amp; Open science community. Additionally:
<ul>
<li>Support transition for post-workshop researchers to do their science longer-term (“fledging”)</li>
<li>Scoping 3 years ahead - understand how people use Hub &amp; Cloud - what it costs, metrics. Quantifying open science outcomes - report back our successes</li>

<p>In 2024 we introduced earthaccess Hackdays - specific times biweekly for the NASA Openscapes Mentors and broader community to co-develop the <code>earthaccess</code> python library. We led the 2024 cohort of science Champions (<a href="https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/news/2024-07-24-2024-nasa-champions-cohort/">blog summary</a>) as well as many mission and data specific workshops in person and online. We focused on “fledging” to explore the question of where do users go to do real science after they have learned in our 2i2c JupyterHub? We also continued collaborating with 2i2c and NOAA Fisheries to develop cloud in-frastructure to support NASA Earthdata users and explore costs per user and per science workflow (<a href="https://openscapes.cloud/fledging.html">cloud infrastructure information</a>).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mentors-retreat-2024">Mentors Retreat 2024</h3>
<p><strong>We are excited to be hosting a NASA Openscapes Mentors Retreat Oct 16-17 2024 (remotely, online).</strong> Please share this email with your DAAC Managers. This retreat will bring together user support staff from across the DAACs that have engaged as leaders through NASA Openscapes and are helping users migrate workflows using NASA Earthdata to the cloud. It is also a way to onboard new user support staff as mentors. NASA Openscapes is not meant to be extra time, but time where people do their existing work in a different way – with open source science workflows to tackle common things together. We have seen the biggest momentum when there are 2-3 mentors at each DAAC, so that pairs/trios can work together within their DAAC as they bring back what they learn from cross-DAAC work. NASA Openscapes Lead Julie Lowndes is happy to email/meet with mentors and managers for any questions. Thank you to DAAC Managers and ESDIS for supporting staff in this way, it makes a real impact – more momentum &amp; background below. This remote retreat will be co-designed &amp; led with Liz Neeley of Liminal, a hero-expert in science communication and sensemaking and who has been getting to know you and your work over the past months.</p>
<p><strong>Retreat Details - Oct 16-17 2024, 10am-2pm PT each day (remotely, online).</strong> We see the main value of this retreat as a chance to reconnect and ​​reinvigorate our cross-DAAC community going into fall. We will hear from many voices to share progress and barriers to support users, and onboard more of our growing community as contributors as we refine our shared vision for momentum forward. We will follow up with report-out summaries and ways to contribute for mentors not able to join.</p>
<p><strong>Momentum - NASA Openscapes Mentors have created “go-to” resources for staff and users across DAACs</strong> <strong>– such as the earthaccess python library and tutorials in the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook.</strong> Over the last 3.5 years, mentors have developed a supportive community and created these resources in response to teaching hundreds of DAAC users via workshops and events together, and then further iterated through active use, documentation, and teaching. Recent presentations showcasing this work is <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-TiPN8bfY6iDL5EVcEuCQSjqFMs3jPSX2MlNWA6no2E/edit#slide=id.g2eae202a90f_4_248">Supporting NASA Earthdata users in the Cloud: NASA Openscapes onboarding &amp; fledging</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D3C2_wBSHAPMNes0hLQHjaRuU_ifEzcKIvf3_H5rZGM/edit#slide=id.g269ad4ab477_0_691">earthaccess: how to accelerate user value through open, collaborative development</a>; all work is developed openly and linked from <a href="https://nasa-openscapes.github.io" class="uri">https://nasa-openscapes.github.io</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background - Openscapes is an open source approach and a movement.</strong> It is a way to work together that shifts culture by helping people find each other and collaboratively evolve their work with modern and kind open data science workflows. Openscapes launched in 2018 through funding from Mozilla, via an open science fellowship awarded to Julia Lowndes. Openscapes grew with funding from NASA Earthdata, via decades-long community building leadership by Erin Robinson. In addition to our flagship Champions program that helps science teams shift workflows to open science, we lead multi-year projects with NASA and NOAA. Our NASA work supports scientific researchers using data from NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud; our NOAA work is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act funds to support NOAA Fisheries’ data, infrastructure, and workforce modernization.</p>
