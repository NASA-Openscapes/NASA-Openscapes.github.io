Earth science is changing. We support scientists using data from NASA Earthdata served from the Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud.

We are influenced and inspired by many leaders and community organizers, particularly in the climate and get out the vote movements. That means, we know this isn't just about us or an effort we can do alone. We are always looking to learn from, with, and for others.

**Upcoming Events:**

-   [URSSI Summer School in Open Science + Research Software Engineering](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/news/2025-06-29-urssi-summer-school/) organized by NASA-Openscapes Mentor, Joseph H. Kennedy, with support from the Alaska Satellite Facility, August 11th-15th at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Apply by June 29th.

-   [Community Call summary published](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/news/2025-05-01-community-call-hub-cloud-costs/): What we’re learning about cloud costs for Earth science workflows in our JupyterHub.
