<br>

Earth science is changing. We support scientists using data from NASA Earthdata served from the Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud.

We are influenced and inspired by many leaders and community organizers, particularly in climate justice and get out the vote movements. That means, we know this isn't just about us or an effort we can do alone. We are always looking to learn from, with, and for others.

**Upcoming Events:**

-   The [2024 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/news/2024-04-03-nasa-champions/) is a mentorship and professional development opportunity for research teams using NASA Earthdata to learn open science practices and spend time experimenting and planning what their analytical workflows with NASA Earthdata look like in the Cloud. Starts April 3, 2024.

-   [Learn about and use methane plume data from EMIT](news/2024-03-14-emit-methane/) in the EMIT Data Tutorial Series virtual workshop March 14, 2024.
