**Our immediate goals and activities with the Mentors (Mar-Jun) are:** 

- Build a DAAC community of practice through our biweekly Openscapes Cohort Calls, Carpentries Intro Python/Git Workshop and Carpentries Instructor Training 
- Develop participating teams as Mentors and help them practice teaching in a style to prepare them for the Openscapes Champions cohort (Aug-Nov) and AGU (Dec)
- Support them towards establishing a common set of tutorials that they can then build off their DAAC-specific and science examples

**Openscapes Mentors Cohort Calls Summaries**

- **1. March 18 2021**: We started working towards a common understanding of how open science leads to transformational, better science in less time and develop our plan as a Cohort
  - Slide Decks:
  - [Empowering Transformational Science](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SUMiQg0HhD19H-D6DDzTrFQVzub0kOINwJBG59uQCTw/edit#slide=id.p1) - Chelle Gentemann
  - [Better science in less time & Openscapes mindset](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/112Ci1fEaVes6KXPNrJBVjTMrny7j5XM9Giphc3hIMo0/edit?usp=sharing) - Julie Lowndes
- **2. April 1, 2021**: We heard about each otherâ€™s work more and start discussing creating cloud tutorials and thinking about next steps

- **3. April 15, 2021**:  We discussed how the group would like to work together to create teaching materials, and discussed a teaching model for future sessions
- **4. April 29, 2021**: We will discuss how data + common resources + custom tutorials = science users starting to migrate workflows to the cloud, and the LP DAAC will lead a teaching demo
