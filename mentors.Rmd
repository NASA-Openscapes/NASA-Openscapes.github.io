# Mentor Cohort Activities

## 2021

**Our immediate activities with the Mentors are:**

-   Build a DAAC community of practice through our twice monthly Openscapes Cohort Calls, a Carpentries Intro Python/Git Workshop, and Carpentries Instructor Training
-   Develop participating teams as Mentors and help them practice teaching in a style to prepare them for a workshop at the American Geophysical Union Conference (AGU) (Dec) and the Openscapes Champions cohort with research teams (early 2022)
-   Support Mentors towards establishing a common set of tutorials that they can then build off their DAAC-specific and science examples

<br>

### 2021 Cloud Hackathon

The **Cloud Hackathon: Transitioning Earthdata Workflows to the Cloud** is a virtual 5-day (4 hours per day) collaborative open science learning experience aimed at exploring, creating, and promoting effective cloud-based science and applications workflows using NASA Earthdata Cloud data, tools, and services (among others), in support of Earth science data processing and analysis in the era of big data. All details and tutorials are available at: <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/>.<br>
