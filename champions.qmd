title: "NASA Openscapes Champions Program"
description: |
  NASA Openscapes Champions is a mentorship and professional development opportunity for research teams using data from NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) and interested in open science and migrating their analytical workflows to the cloud.

**Join us for our 2025-2026 NASA Champions Series, details below.**



## Overview

[**Openscapes**](https://openscapes.org) is an approach and a movement for doing better science in less time[^1],[^2]. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative research communities. Openscapes' mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science[^3], enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.

[**Openscapes Champions**](https://openscapes.org/champions) is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. **For NASA Openscapes, participants also spend time experimenting and planning what their analytical workflows with NASA Earthdata look like in the Cloud**. 

[**NASA Openscapes**](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io) is a project to support scientists using data from NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud. As part of this work, we will offer the Openscapes Champions program several times from 2024-2026.

## Champions Program Details

We are trying something different in 2025-2026. We are modifying the traditional Champions structure to be more light-weight so that participants can engage at whatever level they can (rather than the full cohort-based model of usual Champions programs). Our goals continue to be to expand knowledge and use of NASA Earthdata, building on momentum behind the `earthaccess` python library and workflows in the Cloud.


**In Fall 2025 we will lead 1 Community Call + 1 Coworking session**: a welcome to NASA Earthdata and earthaccess. 

-   **Dates:** November 13 & 14
-   **Times:** 10:00am - 1:00 pm Pacific Time
-   **Where:** remotely, via Zoom
-   **Cost:** Free; this opportunity is supported by NASA funding to Openscapes

### Registration

Register here: TBD


Then, 

**In Winter 2026 we will lead a 4-Part Series of Community Calls and Coworking sessions **, likely February - April. Details and registration coming soon. 



<!---
**This NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort will run from April-May 2024!** We will meet as a cohort five times over two months, on alternating Wednesdays, with additional optional coworking times. 

-   **Dates:** April 3, 17, May 1, 15, 29.
-   **Times:** 10:00-11:30 am Pacific Time
-   **Where:** remotely, via Zoom
-   **What we learn:** details coming soon, see the [2023 cohort webpage](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2023-nasa-champions/)
-   **Who:** Cohort of 7 research groups that work with NASA Earthdata and interested in workflows in the Cloud. Each team consists of a team lead (faculty, principal investigator, etc) and up to 4 team members of your choice (graduate students, post docs, research techs, etc). Teams can also be collaborating in other ways and do not need to be a formal research group.
-   **Cost:** Free; this opportunity is supported by NASA funding to Openscapes
-   **Expected time commitment:** 8hrs/month for 2 months is a minimum expected time commitment. This accounts for 3 hours/month of synchronous Cohort Calls, optional Coworking hours, and team Seaside Chats where you plan with your research group to strengthen shared workflows.

## Nominate your team for Spring 2024

**Nominate your team by completing [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/N5TuCwUXQPipL8Y77) by March 19, 2024** - date extended. This opportunity is open only to research groups that work with data from [NASA Data Centers [DAACs]](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/daacs). Priority will be given to researchers using data from DAACs participating in Openscapes this year: LP DAAC, NSIDC, PO.DAAC, GES DISC, ASDC, ORNL DAAC, ASDC, OBDAAC, LAADS, GHRC, SEDAC, and ASF.

Please submit one nomination per team, preferably by the team lead (faculty, principal investigator, etc). Participants from previous cohorts are welcome. We will confirm participation on a rolling basis.
