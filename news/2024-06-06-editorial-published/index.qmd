We are so happy to share that a paper co-authored by Openscapes mentors across organizations – including NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, EPA, California Water Boards, Pathways to Open Science, Fred Hutch Cancer Center – was just published: [Shifting institutional culture to develop climate solutions with Open Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11341). From co-author Anna Holder, Cal EPA / Water Boards: "It’s a short read and quite uplifting and inspirational and provides some more insight and what we’re learning as we implement Openscapes across organizations.”
