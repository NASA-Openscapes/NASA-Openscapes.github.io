We are so thrilled that the Openscapes community is included in the White House Fact Sheet as the [Biden-⁠Harris Administration Marks the Anniversary of OSTP’s Year of Open Science](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/01/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-marks-the-anniversary-of-ostps-year-of-open-science/)!

This is a huge deal — and not only because now you can google "White House Openscapes"! This Fact Sheet celebrates The Year of Open Science and a lot of hard work by many people within and across agencies and communities. Congratulations to the many many people involved in this movement. We are proud and honored to be recognized as part of this work.

While Openscapes supports many groups including US Federal agencies like NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, and the EPA, the Fact Sheet names us specifically as part of our efforts with [NOAA Fisheries Open Science](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/science-data/open-science-noaa-fisheries). We are so grateful to the NOAA Fisheries team members, some of whom are shown and listed below!
