*This is a short note to celebrate a recent workshop with **NUMBER hands-on participants in a Jupyter Hub** led by NASA Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC) with support from the NASA Openscapes project.*

The ASDC led a "Cloud Access Mini-Workshop" demonstrating virtual dataset capabilities through hands-on Jupyter notebook tutorials, where participants accessed TEMPO Level-3 data using Openscapes' 2i2c JupyterHub in AWS Cloud while learning techniques aligned with NASA's Open Science principles. The discussion examined satellite data access challenges from traditional HDF and NetCDF formats rather than cloud-optimized files, which a collaborative team—comprising NASA DAACs, Openscapes, OPeNDAP, and open source contributors—is addressing through DMR++ granule-level references and VirtualiZarr approaches using collection-level references. The successful workshop featured engaging collaborative discussion with hands-on Level-2 TEMPO experimentation that explored treating individual granules as virtual datasets via DMR++ reference files and identified opportunities for earthaccess improvements to simplify virtual datacube configuration. Based on participant feedback and observed engagement, future workshops will benefit from pre-workshop use-case surveys, extended duration for technical depth, tiered complexity examples, and structured breakout sessions to maximize learning outcomes and support users' transition to cloud-native data access approaches. Ideas for improving future such workshops:

-   1\. Enhanced Pre-Workshop Preparation

    -   Survey participants beforehand to collect specific use-cases and tailor examples to real user needs (if able to provide Hub access beforehand).

    -   Provide technical prerequisites checklist to reduce setup time during workshops.

-   2\. Structural Modifications

    -   Extend duration to 3+ hours or multi-session format to accommodate technical depth.

    -   Build in dedicated troubleshooting time and implement breakout groups approach as originally planned.

    -   Establish ongoing Slack channel for post-workshop support and community building.

-   3\. Content & Material Enhancements

    -   Develop tiered examples progressing from simple to complex virtual datacube scenarios.

    -   Include failure case demonstrations to set realistic expectations about technology limitations.

    -   Create visual aids showing tool ecosystem relationships (DMR++, VirtualiZarr, earthaccess) and development status/timelines.

-   4\. Practical Applications Support

    -   Develop decision trees for when to use virtual vs. traditional approaches.

    -   Create before/after workflow comparisons with performance metrics.

    -   Provide clear "next steps" guidance for participants to apply concepts to their own datasets.
