*Note from Julie Lowndes: Our partners [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/) host our NASA Openscapes JupyterHub as part of their mission to support open science and building communities in the cloud using interactive computing.*

*Recently Yuvi Panda and colleagues at 2i2c collaborated with NASA Openscapes Mentors Bri Lind and Erik Bolch and colleagues at the NASA [Land Processes Distributed Activate Archive Center (LP DAAC)](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/) to setup a frictionless shared password access for the [Surface Biology and Geology: VITALS Workshop](https://nasa.github.io/VITALS/). This workshop had 250 participants, and this frictionless approach involved a link shared with participants for access, removing gathering GitHub usernames as the requirement for 2i2c access for a workshop of this size.*
