*On July 29, 2025 Openscapes hosted a Community Call to celebrate `earthaccess`: a Python library helping users leverage the awesomeness of NASA Earthdata. This was a chance for NASA Earthdata scientists and user support staff to share talks that the NASA Openscapes Mentors prepared for the ESIP summer conference. Designed for an audience with many different interests and experiences with `earthaccess`, we started with stories for all to retell, shared exciting new technical development and features, and ended with a vision going forward. We had 67 people attend (planned with 10 days notice), and 40 attend live! Below is a short summary; we encourage you to review slides and recording!*

Why are people interested in the `earthaccess` python library? As you'll see, we built `earthaccess` to support users migrating search, access, and analysis workflows to the AWS Cloud. But it is so much more. From background that we had previously drafted: 

> NASA‚Äôs goal to support Earthdata users migrating to cloud-based workflows would not have been as successful without the `earthaccess` Python library. `earthaccess` solves critical and previously obscure barriers to code-based data access for many users working in the cloud: authentication (via Earthdata Login), search (via the Common Metadata Repository), bulk download, and direct access to (Amazon Web Services \[AWS\] ) object stores. `earthaccess` provides a unified approach to reproducible data search and access, whether users work on a local machine or in the cloud, and regardless of where data are stored. Being widely used, community developed, and with 200+ dependent projects, `earthaccess` has become a success story integral to NASA‚Äôs broader Earthdata Cloud adoption.

## Crossing the Chasm at NASA Earthdata with `earthaccess`

Amy Steiker started off by sharing about the initial chasm between users and Earthdata Cloud, using the ‚ÄúCrossing the Chasm‚Äù framing in relation to the `earthaccess` origins. Eli Holmes (NOAA Fisheries) led the Crossing the Chasm session at ESIP last week, presenting how ideas spread through an organization and the challenging gap between early adopters and broader adoption. Amy shared how `earthaccess` was built as the bridge to support users adopting cloud workflows, enabling seamless search, authentication, and access (Figure below).

Amy shared the impact of `earthaccess` using statistics on usage and contributions from the open development community. And while there are new challenges in the face of budget uncertainties and a lack of sustained funding, the intentional culture and community building remains critical to the library‚Äôs success. We can now flip the question of how to support `earthaccess`, and instead ask: How can `earthaccess` support NASA Earthdata? Amy concluded by sharing a vision we‚Äôre building of ‚Äú`earthaccess` with batteries included‚Äù (credit to Andy Barrett, NSIDC) and ‚ÄúWidening the bridge‚Äù, inviting contributors shape the future!

But it is so much more with statistics like 200+ dependent projects, 500+ github stars" fig-align="center" width="80%"}

Amy emphasized how partnerships are critical. She shared how `earthaccess` won the [ESIP](https://www.esipfed.org/) FUNding Friday \$5k, an annual mini-competition awarding small projects that are inspired by ESIP collaboration or participation. We plan to use funds to host an `earthaccess` hackathon at the AGU December meeting - virtually and in person! (Here is the [FUNding Friday video pitch](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMhzMY6M_deh3-Io7vWHcRulOt7MSRwLrngEEd4rnmGEwugjcHBRRaKmYp3KRKoQw/photo/AF1QipMm_1SNrSJ4Z2n9lWv195l-nGIbvldtnQpuMIha?key=Q21XcDNSTnFhUFY3YVo4azNOQ3NTVlhxUDF1blR3) ü•≥üé∂, illustrative of the social infrastructure underpinning how we work. We will continue telling this story, and also trying to [document the timeline](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/discussions/1054#discussioncomment-13916327) getting there).

## **New features and VirtualiZarr**

Joe Kennedy's presentation on virtual datasets focused on how cloud computing paradigms enable small teams to generate near real-time mission-scale derived data products. He showed how virtual datasets are used by the [ITS_LIVE](https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/) project to provide low-latency access to global glacier velocity data from multiple optical, radar, and laser satellite sensors. This is achieved by extracting time series of measurements from a particular location and computing velocities by measuring the distance moved over time. Zarr datasets support this targeted extraction natively. Virtual datasets make this possible for other data storage formats by utilizing metadata (via the [kerchunk](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/index.html) python library) that allows extraction of data for a particular location and time, rather than having to process the entire granules.

Joe put forward a vision where `earthaccess` can generalize this access pattern for all datasets. This work is underway through integrating [VirtualiZarr and Icechunk](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/discussions/956) into `earthaccess`. He emphasized critical challenges in implementing virtual datasets effectively. **The core issue is that cloud optimization isn't just about file formats - it's fundamentally about aligning data organization with data access patterns.** Data providers face difficult trade-offs: chunking data temporally optimizes time series analysis but degrades spatial access performance, and vice versa. Additional complexities include handling authentication, and navigating institutional policies around data egress and regional deployments. Joe stressed that success requires alignment between data providers, services, and community adoption.

## **Deeper specifics with VirtualiZarr** 

Chris Battisto talked about updating and managing VirtualiZarr stores using Icechunk. He highlighted two main approaches for creating Earth data cubes using xarray with NASA Earth data: direct Zarr store access with spatial/temporal subsetting (which requires being in AWS US-West-2), and individual granule download and concatenation (common but memory and storage-bound).

He then explained a third way: Create virtualized datasets with VirtualiZarr, and store (and update) with Icechunk. While virtualized datasets offer significant advantages in terms of scalability and efficiency, Chris noted there are still challenges in getting them to work with all NASA Earth data collections. He encouraged the community to experiment with these tools and share their experiences through the `earthaccess` GitHub repository, and provided [documentation links for getting started](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cbjjlAlVfJq7n7TIt0fgQxz3lwhfRZvX-ctlPQC8D0I/edit?slide=id.g371fb11f7b7_3_37#slide=id.g371fb11f7b7_3_37) with both VirtualiZarr and Icechunk implementations.

Next, Danny Kaufman presented on using virtual datasets with TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution) data. TEMPO monitors air pollution over North America and generates substantial data volumes: approximately 10 Level-2 (L2 - non-gridded) granules per hour and about 5,000 Level-3 (L3 - gridded) granules (2.5 TB)¬† annually. Danny found that L3 data products worked well with `earthaccess`'s virtual dataset implementation, which substantially reduced data access time from about one day when downloading to just \~10 minutes. This dramatic improvement was possible because L3 TEMPO data has both consistent dimension sizes and pre-generated DMR++ reference files, which contain chunk manifests with byte ranges for efficient S3 access. In contrast, L2 TEMPO data failed to work as virtual datasets because of inconsistent dimension sizes across granules, which isn‚Äôt compatible with current Zarr specifications.¬†

Danny showed that roughly 15% (given several caveats) of NASA Earthdata collections have the necessary DMR++ files that are both downloadable and parseable by VirtualiZarr. To further streamline access, the team is working on creating combined reference files that don't rely on DMR++ for the entire Level 3 TEMPO collection. As with all of these initiatives, Danny emphasized that documentation and community learning remain crucial for broader adoption.\

## **Bringing It Home**

Luis Lopez brought us home with a presentation focused on `earthaccess`'s role as a bridge between the current state of NASA Earth Data and a future cloud-native, analysis-ready archive. He emphasized that **`earthaccess` serves as a crucial abstraction layer that helps scientists navigate the complexities of NASA's data systems**. Currently, the library is working to implement smart data access patterns, particularly through virtual data cubes, to enable efficient scientific analysis whether users need time series data or multi-file operations. The immediate technical priorities include handling distributed authentication, optimizing metadata reads, and improving I/O operations.

Looking forward, Luis highlighted a fundamental shift in thinking about NASA's data challenges, quoting Patrick Quinn: ‚ÄúStop Building Tools. Start Fixing Data.‚Äù. He stressed that data should be harmonized and optimized at the source, which would reduce the need for numerous APIs and workarounds. The overarching mission for `earthaccess` is to continue bridging the gap between the current fragmented state of NASA data archives and an ideal future where data can be accessed with the same simple three lines of code regardless of the underlying complexity. This vision aligns with the broader goal of preserving simplicity for users while handling the technical challenges behind the scenes.\
