------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello all,

We are feeling rejuvenated momentum and hope going into Fall 2024, and we hope this newsletter finds you well. We have had some recent big inflection points.

**Openscapes is going to the White House!** Openscapes is being recognized at the “Celebration of the OSTP Year of Open Science Recognition Challenge Winners” on September 19. This is a BIG DEAL and we are excited to share the joy with our community. Our **September 26 Community Call debriefing The White House trip** – which also includes presenting at the Dynamic Convergence Workshop - will continue the celebration as Ileana Fenwick and Julie Lowndes interview each other about their experiences. Please [sign up here](https://openscapes.org/events/2024-09-26-openscapes-whitehouse/)!

**NOAA Fisheries announced a 3-year commitment to open science as part of the Biden-Harris Administration Inflation Reduction Act.** [Openscapes is thrilled to be part of this work](https://openscapes.org/blog/2024-08-19-biden-harris-noaa-fisheries/). We have been scaffolding with NOAA Fisheries for the past few years – through 10 Champions Cohorts and developing a cross-agency grassroots mentor community (read next paragraph about a recent publication!). This is such a celebration for the open science community as a whole, a high-profile example of what open science can look like in the government. It means open science directly helping meet the needs of changing oceans by supporting the NOAA workforce focused on climate resilience for fishing communities. It is also a huge celebration for NASA, whom NOAA has been watching and inspired by for their efforts in open science.

**Read our peer-reviewed paper co-authored by Openscapes mentors across organizations** – including NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, U.S. EPA, California Water Boards, Pathways to Open Science, and the Fred Hutch Cancer Center - recently published in Ecology & Evolution. From co-author Anna Holder, Cal EPA / Water Boards: “It’s a short read and quite uplifting and inspirational and provides some more insight and what we’re learning as we implement Openscapes across organizations.” <https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11341>; [Blog post](https://openscapes.org/blog/2024-06-06-editorial-published/)

[**Openscapes update from Julie Lowndes, summer 2024**](https://openscapes.org/blog/2024-07-18-openscapes-update/) is another big deal. Julie talks about and codifies the Opencapes ethos, the organization’s structure, shares updates on new [core team](https://openscapes.org/team) members Liz Neeley and Andy Teucher, how we all work together, and how we are igniting real culture change across science.

**2023 marked 5 years of Openscapes!** We’ve been reflecting on our momentum and impact, and invite you to share what stands out to you in our [Openscapes Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeImqEDROIOlgSwDFYcneboi5dM5bdBNqsLgQ3OFirU-zraKQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). We’ve been sharing insights via talks and our submission to the Challenge.gov (the catalyst for The White House visit). We plan to share more at a submitted talk at the AGU Fall Meeting in Washington DC in December.

## More highlights

-   Please read [our repor](https://openscapes.org/blog/2024-08-05-pathways-report/)t on our second annual Pathways to Open Science Program and [A letter to researchers that want to make the world a better place](https://openscapes.org/blog/2024-08-09-antoinette-foster-letter-make-the-world-better-place/), by Dr Antoinette Foster. These were supported in part by a Mozilla Alumni Grant to Openscapes and PREreview 

-   We completed our second annual [Reflections](https://openscapes.github.io/booklet/) program; we will continue to grow and offer this as another entryway to open science.

-   September 10: [Forking as a Worldview: A big idea that frames Openscapes thinking](https://openscapes.org/events/2024-09-10-nasa-pi-plenary/). Julie Lowndes gave a plenary talk at NASA’s internal PI Planning meeting and talked about forking as reusing what works in new places, with examples of earthaccess package development forking the open source software dev approach into government, and NASA Openscapes and then NOAA Fisheries Openscapes forking open source frameworks to tackle big challenges (cloud migration, data modernization). And it turns out, forking is the first step of the Openscapes Flywheel :)

Thank you for reading, and for all that you do. Read more about what this amazing community has been up to via [blog posts](https://openscapes.org/blog), talks on our [media page](https://openscapes.org/media) and [events page](https://openscapes.org/events).
