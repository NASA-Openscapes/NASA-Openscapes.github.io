Join the NASA Earthdata Webinar **Wednesday, February 28, 2:00 - 3:30 ET**, to learn how to use the [NASA Openscapes Earthdata Cloud Cookbook](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/)—a compilation of open-source tutorials, workflows, libraries, and cheatsheets that help users find, access, and work with Earth science data.

[**Details and to register**](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/webinars-and-tutorials/openscapes-2024-02-28) (free)

**Abstract**

NASA Openscapes ([nasa-openscapes.github.io](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/)) is a community of NASA data center staff and open science contributors who are supporting researchers migrating workflows to the Cloud. As part of this effort we are openly developing the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook: a compilation of open source tutorials, workflows, and cheatsheets that we have refined through teaching over 20 Cloud workshops with researchers using NASA Earthdata. We support NASA Earthdata users by developing an open science mindset focused on kindness, as well as developing software to reduce time to science and meet researchers where they are. The earthaccess library and corn base image helps researchers access NASA Earthdata in a few lines of code – in Python, R, and MATLAB. We will share about this ongoing work and how we collaborate to share lessons learned and tackle challenges together - and welcome you to join the open science movement.
