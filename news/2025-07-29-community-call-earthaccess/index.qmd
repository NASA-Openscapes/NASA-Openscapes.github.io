Join us to celebrate `earthaccess`, a python library that simplifies search and access of NASA Earth science data to a few lines of code. 

We are sharing talks that the NASA Openscapes Mentors prepared for the ESIP summer conference. Our Community Call includes impact stories, new technical features, and "Open Mic" time for folks to share questions, work, progress â€” we know there is a mosaic of ways people are interested in and have used and contributed to earthaccess, and you're welcome to share it all! We will record the presentations and post on [Openscapes YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@openscapes/videos).
