At this year’s [AGU Fall Meeting](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting), the Openscapes team and mentors and collaborators from across different agencies - NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, EPA, UC Berkeley - will be giving talks and posters and participating in hackathons. Below we list just a few highlights. For a full list and up-to-date information, see our [AGU 2024 planning repo](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2024-agu-planning/) and the [AGU Searchable Schedule](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu24/meetingapp.cgi/Home/0). Have a great Fall Meeting and we hope to connect with you there!
