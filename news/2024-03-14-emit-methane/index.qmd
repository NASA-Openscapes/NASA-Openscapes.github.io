Please join NASA's JPL EMIT Science Team and the LP DAAC for a 2-hour virtual workshop demonstrating how to use methane data products ([EMITL2BCH4ENH v001](https://doi.org/10.5067/EMIT/EMITL2BCH4ENH.001) and [EMITL2BCH4PLM v001](https://doi.org/10.5067/EMIT/EMITL2BCH4PLM.001)) from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) mission at **12:00 pm PST on March 14, 2024**. You can find out more about the [EMIT mission](https://earth.jpl.nasa.gov/emit/), see the contributions these data are making to the [US GHG Center](https://earth.gov/ghgcenter/stories/discovering-large-methane-emissions), watch the [EMIT tutorial series 1-3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO2yB4LGNlWrC5NdxeHMxyAxdwQhSypXe), and explore [EMIT python resources](https://github.com/nasa/EMIT-Data-Resources) before attending.
