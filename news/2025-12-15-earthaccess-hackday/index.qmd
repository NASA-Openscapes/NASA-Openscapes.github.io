------------------------------------------------------------------------

Join us for our [earthaccess](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) hackday in **New Orleans and online**! This hackday is independent of [AGU2025](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting) but conveniently co-located for attendees. Registration is free. Please sign up by November 19, end of day in your time zone. We will send confirmations by November 25.

​[earthaccess](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a Python library that enables authentication, search, and access for NASA Earth science data with just a few lines of code. We see great potential for “growing the family” by integrating with other Earth science data beyond NASA, including NOAA, USGS, Copernicus, and others!

​At this hackday, our goal is to have a workable “growing the family” prototype and roadmap. Please join us if you are interested – there are many ways to contribute and incorporate your ideas and expertise. A hackday to our earthaccess community means we will be collaboratively problem-solving and strategizing around "growing the family", and translating ideas into code and documentation.
