Openscapes is delighted to announce that Julie Lowndes has been selected to receive the Greg Leptoukh Lecture at the AGU 2025 Fall Meeting! This is a huge honor to celebrate the life and achievements of Dr. Greg Leptoukh. It is deeply meaningful because the [NASA Openscapes Mentors](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/mentors) nominated Julie for the award.

**The Greg Leptoukh Lecture** Recognizing Computational and Data Advances that Enable Scientific Discovery was established 2013. From [AGU's webpage](https://www.agu.org/honors/leptoukh):

> The Greg Leptoukh Lecture is presented annually and recognizes significant contributions to informatics, computational, or data sciences through research, education, and related activities. It is given to a mid-career or senior scientist. The Leptoukh Lecture aims to raise awareness of computational and data advances that enable scientific discoveries and to foster continued contributions in informatics and data science.\
> It honors the life of Greg Leptoukh, an Earth scientist who was active in the informatics community and worked on projects related to both data quality and data provenance.

Julie will be receiving the award at the Informatics Section reception during [AGU's annual meeting](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting). She will also give an hour lecture, drawing from experiences and lessons learned working with the informatics and data sciences communities in the last years. Thank you!
