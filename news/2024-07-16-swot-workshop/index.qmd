We have an upcoming free hands-on virtual workshop led by NASA PO.DAAC on data access for the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite. The SWOT session will be held July 16, 2024, as part of the [Hacking Limnology Virtual Summit](https://aquaticdatasciopensci.github.io/), a week-long series of talks and workshops broadly focused on open data science and modeling by early career scientists and researchers. This [remote sensing SWOT session](https://aquaticdatasciopensci.github.io/day2-remote-sensing/) will be introduced by Merritt Harlan from the USGS and feature an exciting talk from Craig Brinkerhoff on SWOT-related research, followed by a 2-hour hands on demonstration by Cassie Nickles with support from NASA Openscapes Mentors. 

To find out more about SWOT, visit the [SWOT PO.DAAC Website](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SWOT) and explore other SWOT tutorials and resources in our [PO.DAAC Cookbook: SWOT Chapter](https://podaac.github.io/tutorials/quarto_text/SWOT.html) ahead of time.

Registration is free and open to all career stages: https://aquaticdatasciopensci.github.io/registration/

The hands-on demonstration will be using this GitHub Repository with Binder: [https://github.com/podaac/2024-SWOT-ECR-Workshop](https://github.com/podaac/2024-SWOT-ECR-Workshop).
