# We created a Zenodo Openscapes Community!

We want to share our work in a way that people can find it, use it, improve it, and cite it, or get credit for their contributions. For people who have participated in our programs like Openscapes Champions[^1], or Pathways to Open Science[^2], we want a robust way to add these to their CV as professional development. For contributors to our open educational resources, like the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook[^3], we want them to get credit and visibility. For people who want to reuse or remix a slide from a presentation, we want them to feel great about it by providing an easy way to cite the presentation. To enable all of this, we created a [Zenodo Openscapes Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/openscapes/) as a semantically meaningful group of selected research products. NASA's Transform to Open Science ([TOPS](https://zenodo.org/communities/tops/)) and the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement's ([CSCCE](https://zenodo.org/communities/cscce/)) Zenodo Communities were inspirations for ours.

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is a general-purpose open repository that allows researchers to deposit research related digital artefacts like research papers, data sets, research software, reports, lesson materials, and presentations. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier ([DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier)) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citable (adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenodo)). Zenodo allows for versioning and we can preserve GitHub repositories in Zenodo too (GitHub itself is *not* a repository!).

## Our use cases

The [Openscapes Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/approach/tooling.html#sec-zenodo) gives instructions for our use cases, with pointers for things that might not be obvious to a first-time user.

-   What do we curate in our Zenodo Openscapes Community?
-   How to add your existing Zenodo record to the Zenodo Openscapes Community
-   How to publish a new record in Zenodo to get a DOI
-   How to get a DOI for materials on GitHub
-   How to cite Openscapes publications

## Bonus things I learned

Of course I want credit for my contributions! When we add an author's ORCID ID to a Zenodo record, their ORCID profile is automatically updated. I learned of this bonus when I uploaded a post on which I'm a co-author, and then received email notification that this record had been added to my ORCID profile. Why is this so cool? An [ORCID ID](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006897334-What-is-my-ORCID-iD-and-how-should-I-use-it-) is a unique, open digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher with the same or a similar name to you. My ORCID profile is a bit like a CV. I use it to collect my research publications (not limited to peer reviewed papers) along with things like education and service on boards. Having it automatically updated is great.

*Associating a Zenodo record with an author's ORCID ID results in that record being automatically listed in their ORCID profile.*

Want to create a Zenodo Community? Play in the [Sandbox](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/) first, where anyone can create and refine a draft Community before publishing it in Zenodo. Creating a Sandbox version forced me to recognize decisions to make before creating the real thing, like: needing to create it from an account that looks professional like "curator", rather than my personal email username; or deciding what types of research products to include or exclude. This webinar section "[How to create a community](https://youtu.be/yj2r8RayIX8?t=734)" screenshares a walk-through that makes things crystal clear.
