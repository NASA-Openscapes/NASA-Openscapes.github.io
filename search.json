She supports research and educator communities seeking to integrate their platforms with software tools and resources that enable effective data access, computing, and results sharing and publishing. She regularly meets with research communities, including site developers and users of data and compute services, developing programs and working with teams to provide implementation and user support. Lisa attended Brown University, Boston University, and Northeastern University.\nQuick links:\nMore and more data is being made available for users on NASA’s Earthdata Cloud platform. NASA Openscapes collaborates with a community of user-support staff across ten of the NASA Earth science Distributed Active Archives (DAACs), with the aim to help researchers transition their computational workflows to the Cloud using NASA Earthdata.\nThrough the NASA Openscapes Champions, an annual program that supports cohorts of science teams, a number of researchers expressed interest in using the data hosted on NASA Earthdata with MATLAB. The initial NASA Openscapes’ JupyterHub platform hosted by 2i2c, and tutorials, were Python-based. However, to make this transition, users need to be able to use software tools that are familiar to them that enable access to the data and can process it. The NASA Openscapes team reached out to MathWorks, developers of MATLAB, to support the effort to integrate MATLAB into NASA Openscapes JupyterHub and tutorials. The goal was to enable direct Cloud data access from MATLAB.\nTogether, our two teams have successfully installed MATLAB on NASA Openscapes JupyterHub, visible in the screenshot below. It is now available for researchers participating in NASA Openscapes affiliated learning events to try out with Earthdata data. Researchers will “bring their own license” (BYOL) and will be prompted to input that information to access MATLAB.\nThe MATLAB implementation on Openscapes JupyterHub consists of\nIn addition, we’ve written a detailed tutorial to help users learn the system and process the data.

We are excited that teams participating in the 2022 and 2023 NASA Openscapes Champions program are already logging into Openscapes and using MATLAB on the platform and continuing to push forward NASA Earthdata Cloud access through MATLAB. We will share more results on this work at the upcoming American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting on Tuesday, December 12.

    "text": "This week we joined a standing meeting with NASA DAAC and ESDIS managers (DMC-ESDIS Telecon). We had 30 minutes to present the goals for the upcoming year, and describe why the increase in roles and responsibilities for the NASA Openscapes Mentors. We were introduced by Justin Rice ESDIS Deputy Project Manager, and were thrilled to have the opportunity to reconnect with this group and share the joy of what the Mentors have done and continue to do together. This blog post outlines our talking points that we covered in the meeting. There was a lot of support for the NASA Openscapes Mentors overall, and for the earthaccess python library. Someone even showed the contributors list, highlighting that contributors came from across DAACs and the broader open science community.\nThis post is addressed to the audience of NASA DAAC and ESDIS managers.\n\n\nSupporting users transitioning to the Cloud across different timelines\nOver the last several years, NASA has been making a transition from on-prem hosted data at each of the DAACs to migrating that data to the cloud. Each of the DAACs has been on its own transition path, with some DAACs nearing (or completely) migrating like PO.DAAC, and others just starting to explore, like the CDDIS DAAC. This shift has had ripple effects on how each of the DAACs supports their users accessing NASA Earthdata in the cloud.\nFortunately, the different timelines of each DAAC mean that we can learn from each other and there are a lot of common elements that can be shared across the DAACs in this transition. That is where our project, the NASA Openscapes project, sits - supporting a community of practice for staff that are charged with helping NASA Earthdata users migrate to the cloud. We want to pause here and underline that all the work that NASA Openscapes Mentors and team do, is in support of NASA Earthdata users.\n\n\nNASA Openscapes goals\nNASA Openscapes has three primary goals set in our initial proposal, that still stand going forward.\nFirst, to develop a NASA Earthdata Mentor community of collaborative cloud data instructors, that co-create, curate, and use shared resources (“make once, use often”).\n\nFrom there, we have connected DAAC staff with similar roles across 11 DAACs and provided space for them to learn from each other, and reuse material (like the cheatsheets).\n\nSecond, to support the Mentors as they empower science teams to migrate their download-intensive data analysis workflows to the cloud to continue to do the premier science that each of you supports.\n\nTo date we’ve supported 17 Champions teams, 285 users active within last 6 months; many of these folks are DAAC staff and from your UWGs (User Working Groups). 480 users logged in ever.\nThe transition takes time, but we are starting to see some initial science success stories! (Aronne Merrelli with PI Nadia Smith - developing CLIMCLAPS data product archived at GES DISC; used the Champions program as proposal planning for NASA ROSES. Aronne developed workflows in 2i2c, learned to parallelize workflows with Coiled, and swapped to his University credit card once he had a functional workflow. Aronne will present to a 2024 Champions Cohort to show what’s possible for better science in less time.\n\nThird, to scale Cloud workshop infrastructure, so that each DAAC can leverage it easily and efficiently.\n\nOur first workshop was the Nov 2021 hackathon led by PO.DAAC and supported by NSIDC, LP DAAC and many other mentors. This hackathon helped the mentors develop the seed material for new-to-cloud audiences. Collectively they have developed a curriculum in the Cloud Cookbook that helps a majority of NASA Earthdata users access data in the cloud. Just at the 2023 AGU Fall Meeting, there were 4 workshops using these common materials, two used the 2i2c JupyterHub, and we had 12 talks and posters that described different elements of the transition to the cloud. And in every slide deck the participating DAACs are recognized and acknowledged. This is a stunning amount of presented work from any group, and we hope that you all feel very proud.\n\nThe NASA Mentors group has rapidly identified user needs and developed resources. Two examples of that are:\nFirst, earthaccess, a Python library being developed openly on GitHub. The initial mechanism to access NASA data in the cloud required 30 lines of bash code that created a netrc file and adding earthdata login credentials to that file to get the AWS Secret keys. This as a first step for a new user to the cloud is a high barrier to entry. Luis Lopez from the NSIDC DAAC led the development of this package and we are grateful for the flexibility and support from NSDIC DAAC to meet this emergent need. Earthaccess now obscures those steps for the user with a single line of Python, and it works across DAACs easily accessing data from NSIDC, LP DAAC, PO.DAAC, and others. It is one of the things that most users comment about being a highlight. Also this early intervention means that just dozens of users experienced the clunky initial approach, but thousands of users moving forward will just know the easy earthaccess approach. We’ve worked directly with R and MATLAB developers from our networks who have developed R and MATLAB libraries as complements to earthaccess, which further enable a large swath of Earthdata users.\nSecond, cheatsheets. We know that Cloud jargon is intense. Cassie Nickles and Catalina Taglialatela from PO.DAAC spearheaded a set of cheat sheets that new users can refer to as they navigate planning and executing their transition to the cloud. They intentionally created them to meet PO.DAAC’s needs but in a way that was generalized so that all DAACs could use them so they are heavily reused in presentations and workshops.\nThere are so many other examples that we could provide of ways creating this space for these folks to work together has led to increased efficiency, overall better support for new users moving to the cloud and has avoided significant friction and frustration that users might have had if each DAAC was working alone. In the last three years, we have seen significant, exciting scientific advances in NASA Earthdata users’ ability to work in the cloud and this is in part thanks to your teams and your investment. Mindsets as leaders across DAACs and in the broader Open Science community\nToday, most DAACs have at least one mentor who is a Carpentries Instructor (many have undergone certification). This is something that our grant paid for and the benefits to each DAAC we hope will pay dividends for better teaching of many topics. All of the mentors are more comfortable teaching the Cloud Cookbook material and live coding in the 2i2c Hub than they were at the beginning. Each DAAC is able to leverage the collective resources for DAAC-specific workshops (a lot of value for a fraction of the cost). Many DAAC staff beyond the named mentors access the 2i2c Hub for DAAC-specific tutorial development, so they also have seen an increase in efficiency utilizing services that our grant and now contract provide.\nI hope that you can see that all of this work is aligned with the mission you are all supporting and not extra. Each mentor gives about .2WYE (work year equivalents) and we estimate that last year we had between 4 and 5 WYE total across the DAACs, in addition to the staff support that our NASA Openscapes team (Erin, Julie, Stefanie) provides ~ 1-2 WYE.\n\n\nGoing forward: the next two years\nWe started this project three years ago. Our hope was to connect with all the DAACs by the end of the award, to build instructor capacity and common tutorial material, and to leave the DAACs in a place where they would continue to sustain the work we started together transitioning users to the cloud.\nIn the next two years the Openscapes team (Erin, Julie and Stefanie) will phase out our involvement in the DAAC support, starting with Erin in July. The user support tasks will not go away at that point. We have been in discussions with Justin over the last eight months about this and have begun to set up scaffolding that documents the process and allows the systems to continue. Likely, when we step fully away it will require 5-6 WYE’s across the DAAC\nWe’d like to use this time to answer any questions you might have, discuss alignment across the DAACs, identify better ways we can support you all and how each of you see your DAACs contributing to this investment. Thank you, we appreciate you and continue to be so grateful for all the time that DAACs have put towards this work.\n\n\n\nSome NASA Openscapes Mentors and colleagues holding puppies at the AGU 2023 conference #NASAPuppyPorters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{robinson2024,\n  author = {Robinson, Erin and Lowndes (Openscapes), Julie and\n    Openscapes Team, NASA},\n  title = {NASA {Openscapes:} {Talking} Points for 3-Year Recap \\&\n    Vision for Next Two Years},\n  date = {2024-02-15},\n  url = {https://openscapes.org/blog/2024-02-15-nasa-openscapes-talking-points/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nRobinson, Erin, Julie Lowndes (Openscapes), and NASA Openscapes Team.\n2024. “NASA Openscapes: Talking Points for 3-Year Recap &\nVision for Next Two Years.” February 15, 2024. https://openscapes.org/blog/2024-02-15-nasa-openscapes-talking-points/."

Many teams were interested in using data from multiple DAACs. User cloud adaption takes time, given the new conceptual mindsets and technical skillsets it requires.

    "text": "NASA Champions Cohort Overview\nNASA Openscapes is a multi-year project to develop a cohesive approach to building cloud migration capacity across NASA Earthdata from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) and the research teams supported by the DAACs. We do this through supporting a community of NASA DAAC mentors, who are primarily dedicated to user support. This community has learned together how to use NASA Earthdata in the Cloud. They have translated that experience into a series of hackathons, workshops, self-paced tutorial material in the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, and through an intensive, 10-week NASA Openscapes Champions program.\nUser cloud adaption can often have a steep learning curve and feel overwhelming. The NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort brings together research teams that are interested in migrating their existing NASA Earthdata workflows to the Cloud with NASA DAAC Mentors who are extremely knowledgeable about the data they serve and the initial pathways to using that data in the Cloud. This Cohort provides a common, welcoming place for teams to learn together, ask questions about using the Cloud, plan their transition, and do initial experimentation using the NASA Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub. Because this is a more intensive experience, the teams build collaborative partnerships with DAAC mentors, and the mentors can more quickly identify and work on solving issues that will make cloud migration easier for many more users. We led the first NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort in 2022.\nThe third NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort ran during April-May 2024 with nine research teams interested in a wide variety of NASA Earthdata and various stages of cloud technology familiarity. You can learn more about their research below.\n\n\n\nVideo conference screen shot (♥) of some researchers in the 2024 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort.\n\n\nTogether as a Champions Cohort, these teams discussed what worked and didn’t work as they migrated workflows to the Cloud, focusing on collaboration and Open Science. We met as a cohort five times over two months on alternating Wednesdays. Each cohort call included a welcome and code of conduct reminder and two teaching sessions with time for reflection in small groups or silent journaling and group discussion before closing with suggestions for future team meeting topics (“Seaside Chats”), Efficiency Tips, and Inclusion Tips. All topics and the slides presented are shared on the 2024 Cohort page. Additional coworking sessions were scheduled on alternate weeks, where researchers could work quietly, screenshare to ask questions, or meet with their team to discuss further. In addition, the teams have access to Openscapes’ 2i2c Jupyter Hub, which will continue for the next year. \nThe NASA Openscapes Mentors supported the Champions and contributed to the curriculum (all available at https://openscapes.github.io/series). In particular, the NASA Openscapes Champions Curriculum had important additions. \n\nAronne Merrelli (University of Michigan, 2023 Champion) shared his experiences of First Forays into the Cloud, and how it’s possible to go from cloud novice to feeling like it’s a superpower and doing real analyses for his American Geophysical Union (AGU) poster (and beyond!). YouTube clip \nCatalina Taglialatela (PO.DAAC) led the Earthdata Cloud Clinic with datasets from several DAACs and using the earthaccess Python library for NASA Earthdata search & access in the Cloud. \nMatt Fisher (NSIDC) updated psychological safety examples - this lesson particularly resonated with the Champions teams who reflected together about how this is important for learning new things. YouTube clip.\nAlexis Hunzinger (GES DISC) extended the Data strategies in the Cloud lesson with considerations of environmental impact /climate change and streaming data in the same way you stream video on a streaming service such as Netflix, without downloading to a local computer or server.\nCassie Nickles (PO.DAAC) walked through and welcomed contributions to NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, a learning-oriented resources hub to support scientific researchers who use NASA Earthdata as NASA migrates data and workflows to the cloud.- YouTube clip.\nBrianna Lind (LP DAAC, KBR Inc., under contract to the U.S. Geological Survey)’s Open Communities lesson solicited many additional examples including Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), US Research Software Engineering (US-RSE), Research Data Alliance (RDA), Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP), CryoCloud, Project Pythia.\nMahsa Jami (LP DAAC, KBR Inc., under contract to the U.S. Geological Survey) shared coding strategies for parallelizing code and dove into parallel processing from a scientist perspective. “Pleasingly parallel” is a term for tasks that are completely independent from each other - for example, to validate whether each value in a dataset is within a threshold. YouTube clip.\nLuis Lopez (NSIDC) demonstrated new interactive features of the earthaccess Python library: earthaccess.explore()which provides interactivity without having to download data. This feature only streams metadata (of the dataset’s spatial coverage, volume size) and not the data itself. earthaccess.explore() enables previewing the data and helps narrow down what you may eventually want to stream to memory or download. Additional features enable you to identify different satellite swath overlaps in a selected area and save egress costs because it works more efficiently. YouTube clip.\nAndy Teucher demoed data storage strategies in the Cloud, first via a notebook tutorial about How to store data in the Cloud (including where to store and how to delete your intermediate & test files) and then about storage strategies & costs. YouTube clip.\n\n\n\n\nLuis López demonstrates new interactive features of the earthaccess Python library that enable users to identify different satellite swath overlaps in a selected area.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure by Andy Teucher showing costs of compute (purple) and storage (blue and green) in the Cloud.

    "text": "What we learned and challenges\nThe Openscapes Champions provides a space for teams to come together to learn from each other and across teams. It is a way to collaborate and distribute leadership roles across the various teams, helping to reduce the burden team leaders often feel of needing to learn everything first before teaching it to the rest of the team. \nHere are the highlights of the third Champions Cohort:\n\nScience teams were using data across DAACs - more this year than ever! It felt great to demonstrate the same earthaccess workflows with datasets from different DAACs.\nEveryone had less capacity to engage this year - both from the Mentors’ side and Champions side. We saw less activity between sessions on Slack and in Coworking. This could in part be video conferencing fatigue, but also might highlight the benefit of people (Mentors + Champions) having additional time outside of the normal five calls to experiment, ask questions, and develop. This kind of engagement has led to useful development in the past (refer to next bullet).\nPast Champions Cohorts have resulted in useful developments, including the earthaccess Python library and MATLAB integration in the Hub. This year, emerging development is around “how to talk to your institution’s IT about your cloud needs” and NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) data access. More to come!\nWe had a lot of “new” content added from what we learned in the last year (Hub storage in S3 buckets, computing concepts, psychological safety!). This meant that we spent less time on core open science skills & practices that we do in the Core Champions Lesson Series (https://openscapes.github.io/series). These core open science skills & practices can help people feel confident and willing to share needs.\nFeedback from participants was valuable:\n\n“Openscapes has allowed me to see that working in Python and in the Cloud is not as scary as I once thought it was. I hope to collaborate more with others that are already using cloud computing so I can get my feet wet in some publishable research using S3 buckets. Where before I would not have thought that I could be a viable contributor.”\n“I used to think that cloud computing was for parallelizing processes and when you needed a really fast computer. I never thought about its ability to store data in a format that is easily accessed for VERY large data sets. I wish that more people in fisheries would start thinking about how their data could be stored in multidimensional arrays rather than flat data frames.”\n“Many people have great ideas but facilitators often have to work to get those ideas out into the open and the same method of getting those ideas out will NOT work on everyone. So, if you care about progress you should care about using multiple avenues to allow people to express themselves.”\n\n\nSeveral challenges working with NASA Earthdata in the Cloud are still unresolved, many which apply more broadly than just NASA data and rather to user adoption of the cloud computing technology in general. These include: \n\nWhile Aronne Merrelli’s story was inspiring, Champions reflected that they find it hard to think about projects that would be good for the Cloud when they have no experience using the Cloud – so how can you find a project to move to the Cloud when your brain won’t let you go there in the first place?\nCost - we still need to have and communicate a better sense of this. We intentionally do not have the “how much does it cost” conversation early on because our intention is to help people experience what it involves and first think about “when to cloud.” However, we do have cost numbers from previous years and plan to gather more cost statistics for the upcoming ESIP summer meeting.\nWe need to think about storage differently in the Cloud because users pay daily to store data in the Cloud. Champions commented that they often “over-produce” files because storage is cheap and access is easy on local machines. How do we learn what is really important and what we can “toss”?\nFolks had interest in learning more about working with confidential data in the Cloud, as researchers often combine non-NASA data for their analyses and this is expected to be an increasing need.\nSeveral themes/questions recurred that we have heard before and for which remain as open questions. Importantly, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud onboarding, when to use what resources, how to set them up, and how to discuss needs with organizational leadership and IT staff, often falls outside the scope of NASA DAACs, yet it’s a key element of helping users adopt the Cloud and use NASA data in the Cloud. It is encouraging to hear some of the champions starting to have conversations with their institutions, IT departments, and making their needs known, which is likely a big part of the solution, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure by Alexis Hunzinger showing the focus of cloud for data storage and compute.

    "text": "Team Pathways and Cloud Momentum\nPart of the Openscapes Champions approach is that teams decide what to work on. The teams devoted at least 8 hours a month to focus on their workflows, learning, and collaborating within and across their teams. During this time, they thought through and discussed their current NASA Earthdata workflows and planned and experimented with transitioning their workflows to the Cloud using Openscapes’ 2i2c-hosted Jupyter Hub as a first step. As in other Openscapes Champions cohorts, teams also realized the power of Open Science and that open is a spectrum that includes considering future us - potentially just you or your group in 3 months. \n“Fledging” was a big theme this year, especially following Aronne Merrelli’s talk. We think of this as where do researchers go to do their real science, when they leave the Openscapes 2i2c Hub for experimental purposes? What do they need to know in terms of cost estimates, docker images, administrative personnel (potentially both technical and policy)? We saw teams and the NASA DAAC mentors make substantial progress in migrating workflows to the Cloud. A few highlights from teams that participated in the cohort included:\n\n\nThe Ocean Science Analytics team experimented with and found ‎earthaccess to be insightful and useful! This was valuable as a hands-on activity. The team members have questions about setting up AWS on their own and would like to understand what tools are needed for a specific task. For example, when could dask, an open-source Python library for parallel computing, be used for a task or would another tool be more appropriate?\nThe NOAA IEA (Integrated Ecosystem Assessment) team benefitted from having an improved conceptual understanding of what is involved with cloud workflows – they would like to work with NOAA IT to understand what’s available and possible with JupyterHubs and find workable solutions, now that we understand more of the possibilities.\nThe PACE Hackweek team found Hubs ‎very instrumental in learning cloud computing and helping to create hackweek tutorials. They have used their seaside chats for tutorial development, using GitHub, and have included people outside their team. They have gained more understanding about AWS EC2/storage service by having conversations with Science Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE) for gaining access to Open Science Studio (OSS).\nThe NOAA Coastwatch team took what they learned from the Earthdata Cloud Clinic and reused it to teach 70 colleagues from across NOAA at the NOAA Enterprise Data Management Workshop in their EDMW-EarthData-Workshop-2024. They taught the same tutorials twice, first in Python using earthaccess and then in R using earthdatalogin.\nThe Wimberly Lab Team shared their pathway with a bridge metaphor and how they are tackling challenges through talking about this in lab meetings and learning new tools together. \nAsynchronously, Lucas Barbedo from the Liu-Zhang team shared about using NASA PACE data [comment + thread] in the 2i2c JupyterHub following the Earthdata Cloud Clinic, and shared progress through a GitHub discussion: What’s happening on the NASA Openscapes Hub!? . \n\n\n\n\nFigure by Wimberly Lab (Yusuf Jamal) showing the teams’ pathway with a bridge metaphor. \n\n\nAdditional Cloud resources shared from the NOAA Enterprise Data Management Workshop\n\nhttps://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/\nhttps://abarciauskas-bgse.github.io/presentations/noaa-edmw-intro-2024‎\nhttps://projectpythia.org/dask-cookbook/"

    "text": "Onward!\nIf the 2024 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort is any indication, the NASA Earthdata community is making substantial strides in building capacity to use cloud resources, and the transition is successfully happening. Although the cohort is officially over, these teams are just at their beginning, and we are excited to follow their results as they experiment with parallelizing code and incorporating storage considerations in their workflows. We plan to continue to work with them in the next year, as their 2i2c managed cloud Hub access continues. As we did last year, we are planning to offer the Carpentries Instructor Training for interested Champions this summer. The Carpentries is a nonprofit that teaches introductory coding skills around the world. Instructor Training is not coding-specific, but it is an educational approach to teaching technical topics. As part of our NASA grant, we have partnered with The Carpentries and are excited to extend this opportunity to Champions because many of them mentioned wanting to contribute more to open science efforts going forward.\nWe are grateful to this Champion Cohort for their early adopter spirit, their time and effort to make this migration, and all the feedback and input they provided. They all participated in this cohort, knowing that while this was the third Cohort, they were among the first research teams to use NASA Earthdata in the Cloud. What they learned and shared will make it easier for subsequent teams to make this same shift. Many teams articulated this spirit of open leadership, explicitly asking how they could help other teams. We also learned so much from this cohort, which will help us refine the NASA Openscapes Champions program, as we plan for our next cohort and our work with the DAAC mentors in the future years of our project."

    "section": "About the NASA Openscapes Champions Teams",
    "text": "About the NASA Openscapes Champions Teams\nThe Liu-Zhang (University of Louisiana at Lafayette & University of Southern Mississippi) team primarily uses NASA Earthdata Search to access datasets from Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) and The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) missions, which we then use to create algorithms for ecosystem analysis. We have a particular interest in using hyperspectral data, such as the upcoming PACE data to study vegetation and algae in water bodies. Our work involves developing deep learning models for habitat classification and analyzing water quality. Transitioning to hyperspectral imaging and deep learning greatly increases computational demands, making it challenging to execute code locally compared to leveraging cloud computing resources. Additionally, this transition enhances the accessibility of our algorithm to the public. Currently funded by EMIT and serving as early adopters of PACE, we are eager to contribute to the NASA Cookbook by offering new algorithms that apply to NASA’s latest satellite data, such as EMIT and PACE.\nThe Ocean Science Analytics team incorporates NASA data in our studies of coastal and offshore marine regions, specifically as it pertains to marine mammals. Combining in situ data from hydrophones to determine the vocal occurrence of marine mammals with remotely sensed ocean color data, we use chlorophyll, net primary productivity, sea surface temperature, etc. to characterize the associated habitat and document changes over time. As a PACE early adopter, we are incorporating PACE data in our studies through large scale observations of photosynthesizing organisms, which will allow us to incorporate direct measurements of the presence and distributions of plankton species. This in connection with feeding behavior will provide a better understanding of the spatial use of these habitats.\nThe PACE Hackweek team supports the NASA PACE mission, which launched in February 2024 and is collecting unprecedented data from our global oceans, atmosphere, and land. PACE data will be hosted in the Cloud; therefore, we are interested in learning more about cloud-based workflows to access and analyze PACE data and contribute our efforts and outcomes to our community of end-users.\nThe NOAA CoastWatch team is motivated by how rising ocean temperatures, higher sea levels, melting ice, and increasing ocean acidity are changing the way marine life and ecosystems function in our world’s oceans. This affects everything from how we manage fisheries and protect communities that depend on fishing to how we protect important habitats and species. The ocean is expected to continue changing and changes are expected to become more extreme. A lot is at stake. Improving how we use Earth data in our workflows is essential. We have much we can learn about migrating to the Cloud by connecting with other earth science teams at NASA and with the NASA Openscapes mentors.\nThe Wimberly Lab (University of Oklahoma) team explores the impacts of changing climate and landscapes on ecosystems and human health, with an emphasis on developing spatial decision support tools to support public health decisions, land use planning, and natural resource management. We address these topics through landscape, regional, and global analyses using satellite remote sensing and other sources of environmental monitoring data. Specific research areas include the effects of environmental change on vector-borne disease outbreaks, the influences of human land use and wildfires on forest landscape dynamics, the impacts of agricultural expansion and intensification on native ecosystems, and the development of computer software for disease outbreak forecasting and landscape change modeling. We conduct our research in locations throughout the world including North America, West Africa, Ethiopia, and India.\nThe NOAA IEA team’s approach provides cross-disciplinary science to support ecosystem-based management in the Gulf of Mexico. For example, we conduct research on climate-fisheries interactions, changes in species ranges and distributions, and environmental impacts on fisheries such as those driven by harmful algal blooms. We use data from earth system modeling and remotely sensed data, including sea surface temperature, sea surface height, ocean currents, wind, ocean color, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and primary production indices. We are particularly interested in integrating modern open-science techniques to automate our core deliverables, called Ecosystem Status Reports, and other data products related to NOAA surveys. We’re beginning to test some of these approaches in ongoing projects. For example, the ongoing IEA-Wind project aims to develop data baselines to track the impacts of forthcoming offshore wind energy infrastructure development. The project has been conceptualized and executed thus far with an open-data approach. We believe that a deeper understanding of the concepts and approaches offered by this Cohort would allow for a more holistic application across Gulf of Mexico IEA efforts. \nThe NASA SERVIR Central America team are representatives of Costa Rica’s National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC, in Spanish), the Forest Research and Services Institute of the National University of Costa Rica, and the Central America Aerospace Network (RAC, in Spanish). The NASA / USAID SERVIR program is helping to connect the Costa Rican researchers with Openscapes. The team is responsible for generating Costa Rica’s official national forest cover maps, in the context of its national forest monitoring system. Therefore, involving the team will have a notable national impact in terms of their reporting to international commitments (e.g., the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 15.2). The team is currently using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to access and process data from Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical). They combine these datasets and perform a supervised classification to generate land cover maps. While the team’s workflow is already in the Cloud (via GEE), they are interested in exploring additional computational capabilities that may be available via AWS for processing big data, including the inclusion of other datasets like that of the Landsat archive.\nThe POSTECH (University South Korea) team is actively engaged in climate modeling research, utilizing both Python and NCAR Command Language (NCL) scripts to analyze climate data. We are eager to expand our knowledge and skills by collaborating with experts in the field, and we are keen to explore new methodologies and insights. Joining your team presents an exciting opportunity for us to enhance our expertise and broaden our exposure to cutting-edge techniques in climate science.\nDisclaimer: Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.\nReference herein to any specific commercial product, process, or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply its endorsement by the United States Government or the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology."

    "text": "Why we work: motivated by climate and social change\n\n\n“What if we connected our skills & values as a daily practice, for climate?”\n\n\nWe kicked off our talk with this question to center the motivation for the work we do. As the NASA Openscapes Mentors had given many talks, workshops, and posters throughout the week showcasing and teaching their shared work, we summarized their efforts with a quote from Cassie Nickles:\n\n\n“NASA Openscapes is a collaborative environment for data center [DAAC] staff to collectively support open science initiatives for NASA Earthdata users. We’ve developed awesome material to help Earthdata users (cheatsheets, a python package (earthaccess), NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook).\nPerhaps just as important as what we’ve done however, are mindsets we’ve grown into along the way. It’s okay to share imperfect works in progress. Ideas are not too big or too small to share. We are better at dreaming and implementing the future together.” – Cassie Nickles (PO.DAAC)\n\n\nThen we centered our talk on a layer above: how we work to support these amazing user support staff to collaborate across data centers and as early adopters, co-develop teaching resources and infrastructure to support researchers in the Cloud."

We reach for the Flywheel as a tool for planning, implementation and communication, just as we reach for R, Quarto, and JupyterHubs for analysis, documentation, and cloud computing.\nThe Flywheel is a concept developed by Jim Collins, where transformations occur from consistently doing key activities that add up over time. The Openscapes Flywheel at its simplest form has six steps that we repeat daily, monthly, and over years. Starting from the bottom and going clockwise: Leverage common workflows, skills, and tools; Inspire; Welcome; Create space & place; Invest in learning and trust; Work openly.\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes Flywheel\n\n\n\nWe talked through what this looked like for the NASA Openscapes project in Year 1, and then again in Years 2-3 as the Flywheel gained momentum as the Mentor community grew and supported researchers on the Cloud."

For people who have participated in our programs like Openscapes Champions1, or Pathways to Open Science2, we want a robust way to add these to their CV as professional development. For contributors to our open educational resources, like the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook3, we want them to get credit and visibility. For people who want to reuse or remix a slide from a presentation, we want them to feel great about it by providing an easy way to cite the presentation. To enable all of this, we created a Zenodo Openscapes Community as a semantically meaningful group of selected research products. NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) and the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement’s (CSCCE) Zenodo Communities were inspirations for ours.\nZenodo is a general-purpose open repository that allows researchers to deposit research related digital artefacts like research papers, data sets, research software, reports, lesson materials, and presentations. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citable (adapted from Wikipedia). Zenodo allows for versioning and we can preserve GitHub repositories in Zenodo too (GitHub itself is not a repository!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes Approach Guide gives instructions for our use cases, with pointers for things that might not be obvious to a first-time user.\n\nWhat do we curate in our Zenodo Openscapes Community?\nHow to add your existing Zenodo record to the Zenodo Openscapes Community\nHow to publish a new record in Zenodo to get a DOI\nHow to get a DOI for materials on GitHub\nHow to cite Openscapes publications\n\n\n\n\nOf course I want credit for my contributions! When we add an author’s ORCID ID to a Zenodo record, their ORCID profile is automatically updated. I learned of this bonus when I uploaded a post on which I’m a co-author, and then received email notification that this record had been added to my ORCID profile. Why is this so cool? An ORCID ID is a unique, open digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher with the same or a similar name to you. My ORCID profile is a bit like a CV. I use it to collect my research publications (not limited to peer reviewed papers) along with things like education and service on boards. Having it automatically updated is great.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociating a Zenodo record with an author’s ORCID ID results in that record being automatically listed in their ORCID profile.\n\n\nWant to create a Zenodo Community? Play in the Sandbox first, where anyone can create and refine a draft Community before publishing it in Zenodo. Creating a Sandbox version forced me to recognize decisions to make before creating the real thing, like: needing to create it from an account that looks professional like “curator”, rather than my personal email username; or deciding what types of research products to include or exclude.

    "text": "Cloud Takeaways from Aronne Merrelli\nAronne Merrelli, University of Michigan, is a research scientist and a 2023 NASA Openscapes Champion, and he shared his story with 2024 Champions teams. His main takeaways:\n\nFinds cloud to be “a super power”\n\nNew science questions: can process data too big to imagine processing in current places\nDetails: “I did an analysis for my AGU poster: 150 TB of L1 and L2 data, and I only needed some tiny fraction that were of interest to me. In the old way I would need to find a way to download it all first, and I don’t have a machine big enough. But parallelizing with Coiled, I can subset. Now once I realize that, I realize there are bigger datasets that just seemed unworkable before.” - Aronne Merrelli\n\nCloud costs: cheaper than expected\n\nMatt Rocklin’s “Rule of Thumb”: $0.10 per TB, so processing 150 TB would be roughly $15\nThinking for grant proposals: ~$100s/yr will go a long way\n\nInfrastructure: less intensive than expected\n\nShifting workflow to earthaccess then parallelizing with Coiled. Little setup required\n\n\nAronne describes himself as a Level 1 or Level 2 algorithm scientist. He had been interested in learning how to use the cloud and had some previous unhelpful experiences, since most discussions revolved around the administration of cloud services that made it seem like there was a large overhead to using the cloud, including specialized packages that seemed hard to use, or inefficient on datasets he uses."

Learning in the 2i2c JupyterHub and then with Coiled, he could focus on the science and not require a cloud optimized data format. The key thing is that he didn’t really need to modify his workflow! He sees cloud computing as a new capability that allows him to do analyses on big data sets that would have been hard to do on any other machine. Here are the steps of what fledging looked like:\n\nLearned when and how to cloud (via NASA Openscapes Champions cohort)\n\nCross-DAAC Mentors led, scientist focused, open science, inclusive (Aronne’s previous attempts to learn were geared towards engineers)\n\nExperimented in JupyterHub (managed by 2i2c & Openscapes, NASA credits)\n\nExtremely easy to get your ‘toes in the water’ running code in the cloud\nRan tutorials, prototyped code, easy with earthaccess & corn environment \n\nExperimented in Coiled (managed by Coiled & Openscapes, NASA credits)\n\nVery easy to use, essentially zero administrative overhead\nLearned to parallelize code in small pieces, easy transition to my workflow\n\nDid real science in Coiled (managed by Coiled & University credit card!!!)\n\nUM’s institutional AWS account is a big help here\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide from Aronne Merrelli showing how cloud computing is a new way to work: “see this as a new capability that allows me to do analyses on big data sets that would have been hard to do on any other machine.”"

This first example is the hardest, and we expect more to come (like a flywheel that is toughest to spin the first time, ten times, hundred times.)\nThanks so much to Aronne for sharing what he learned with the NASA Openscapes Mentors, 2024 Champions science teams and other audiences.

The purpose of the session was to explore opportunities to support the activities of these programs through formation of a Carpentries subcommunity. A Carpentries subcommunity is defined as “a subset of our global community that can be local, regional, domain-specific, or a group of community members sharing a common language or interests.” Anyone interested in developing an engaged network of Instructors was invited to attend the session, resulting in 56 community members representing multiple US government agencies, state governments, universities, and non-profits.\nThe session began with three short presentations by representatives from each of the three NASA programs, which are summarised and with the presentation slides below."

    "text": "Opportunities for a NASA Subcommunity\nFrom the three presentations it was clear that across NASA, these programs find real benefits leveraging The Carpentries to extend data science skills within NASA’s internal and external communities of practice. As new Instructors complete training in support of these programs, there exist opportunities to build a subcommunity through programming and resources available through The Carpentries Community Development Program.\nAttendees discussed this general interest in forming a cross-NASA Carpentries subcommunity. To kick-off the discussion, Elizabeth Joyner led attendees in two rounds of 3-2-1 silent reflection where she asked participants to list three data science and coding skills that researchers and practical data users need at NASA, two questions about Carpentries subcommunities, and one metaphor or simile about what you envision for a thriving subcommunity of Carpentries Instructors. As we closed out of this discussion, clear themes emerged; attendees are interested in increasing efficiency with data, working more openly and collaboratively with data, building and maintaining reproducible workflows and increasing data fluency and dexterity with NASA data (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1 - Word cloud of 50 most common words across both 3-2-1 exercises.\n\n\n\nFrom the second part of the reflection, the questions generated by the group acted as a starting point for a lively discussion, which will hopefully continue to be good fodder for the subcommunity to develop its initial charge. There were questions about how to find additional Instructors across NASA and who might be missing from this discussion. There were also questions about how to engage NASA grantees and other stakeholders who use NASA data, as well as about how to extend the curriculum being taught and explicit pointers to Library Carpentries.\nThe third prompt was for a metaphor or simile of a thriving community. Some of our favourite imagery was that a thriving community is like a networked dream catcher, a bee hive, or three goats on each other’s shoulders in a trenchcoat trying to sneak in.\nFollowing the teaching model advocated by The Carpentries, the three NASA programs have all intentionally cultivated communities that support learners and support ongoing learning. Considering this, there is general excitement about the possibility of a NASA subcommunity with 20 attendees indicating interest in joining a follow-up conversation."

All our lessons, curriculum, writing (blog posts, peer reviewed publications, slides, etc) are open source and shared publicly online – using the same tools we teach for data analysis and reproducible reports (GitHub, Quarto/RMarkdown, R, Python, Jupyter, Google Drive). We believe role-modeling open practices is critical to helping teams shift towards open science.\nOpenscapes is motivated by a question: What if we connected our skills & values in our daily work, for solutions to our most pressing climate and justice challenges? We work with actionable science teams at agencies like NASA Earth Science, NOAA Fisheries, EPA, California Water Boards, academic and non-profit groups like the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science and Black in Marine Science. In our work we think that combining data science with open science with teamwork & community, is a way for us all to help address our climate emergency. As Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and Katharine Wilkinson say in the book All We Can Save: “To address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape society. We need every solution and every solver”."

    "text": "IGNITING REAL CULTURE CHANGE ACROSS SCIENCE\nWe are seeing real culture change across science through the Openscapes approach. This is a big deal and something I am really proud of. Change shows up as real improvements in how individuals, teams, and organizations operate. We see researchers’ daily efficiency and wellbeing benefit whole organizations since there is less time wasted, errors are identified and fixed earlier, and staff have less burnout and turnover. Through the Champions Program, we’ve seen a senior administrator who had participated for weeks on mute suddenly unmute, lean forward, and say “I need that, can you teach me?” when a colleague was screensharing their workflow for automating data-intensive reports. Through NASA Openscapes co-led with Erin Robinson, we have changed the way NASA teaches how to access Earthdata in the cloud. With NASA, NOAA, and the California Water Boards, we are supporting within-government open source community development that flourishes across historical institutional silos: examples include the earthaccess python library, Dr. Eli Holmes’s new 3-year position as NOAA Fisheries Open Science Lead, and the California Environmental Protection Agency’s (CalEPA) open data strategy (see the upcoming July Executive Director Report: https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_info/exec_dir_rpts).\n2023 marked 5 years of Openscapes! We have done and learned a lot – look out for an upcoming blog post with more details. But to share some – in early 2024, Openscapes was mentioned in the White House Fact Sheet as the Biden-⁠Harris Administration Marks the Anniversary of OSTP’s Year of Open Science! We’ve led 155 science teams through our flagship Champions program, upskilled 90 Mentors across several government organizations, and welcomed 120 Black marine and environmental scientists to Open Science through the Pathways Program. We’ve also led two years of the Reflections program, a lower-commitment way for people to participate in Openscapes and build open science skills. But real culture change is less about us leading events and more about the Openscapes approach and Flywheel spinning around the world as people practice, reuse, and teach it themselves. Openscapes has been successful because we are small, independent, and outside the organizations we work with, and teaching approaches that can be incorporated within organizations (for example with the CalEPA). We are keeping that going."

    "section": "AN OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY",
    "text": "AN OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY\nI’ve come to think of Openscapes itself as an open source community, which yes, might be obvious, and was the goal all along. But I realize it actually is. We as a community — and linked to many other communities all along the open spectrum — are all role modeling open, living open science as a process and daily activity (not only a product at the end), and bringing reuse and extension as a value of open. It’s happening!\nPart of the community being open source is that all our resources are open source; you’re welcome to them. We think of the Flywheel as an open source tool — I reach for the Flywheel when we are planning, designing programs, communicating impact, just as I reach for R and Quarto and JupyterHubs when I am doing data analysis. We also invest heavily in open documentation: through the Champions Lesson Series resources and the Approach Guide that document how we work and facilitate – these are other open source resources to reuse and extend, the way you would an R or Python package. It takes real work and time to make things open – that means posting on YouTube and formatting for GitHub rather than a PDF sitting in a corner of our laptops. Funding supports our time working with partners, and also invests in this work to keep the Flywheel going.\n“Forking” is a concept from GitHub and software programming where you can copy someone’s work into your own space to reuse/remix/extend it. It is still attached to the original source so that you can be connected, give credit, and also contribute back, if your changes might be useful to the original project. We are thrilled to see people “forking Openscapes” like teaching from each other’s slide decks, copying live notes and agenda structure, and reusing Champions cohorts and event structure to better suit audiences, like the CalEPA has done."

    "section": "OUR CORE TEAM",
    "text": "OUR CORE TEAM\nOpenscapes has an intentionally small core team. As we have grown, we have tried to keep a deliberately flattened organizational structure that works effectively and has the impact of a much bigger team. We define the core team right now as people who are paid directly from Openscapes funds (grants & contracts). Sustainability of people’s workload and financing is front of mind. Outside of me (aiming for 90% time), team members work up to 50% time, with everyone working as much as they want to. Our core team has shifted this year, and you’ll see these changes reflected in our website too.\nFirst, a huge thank you to Erin Robinson, who was instrumental in growing Openscapes into a sustainable initiative via her expertise in strategic sustainability planning and her leadership with the NASA Earthdata community. Erin Robinson has shifted off the core team: she is currently finishing her PhD in Information Science focused on knowledge infrastructures for Earth and environmental science applications and consulting with her company Metadata Game Changers. I have learned so much working together with Erin, it could be a whole book in itself. I’m so proud of the Openscapes Flywheel we developed together and that Jim Collins responded to us saying he was excited about our work when we shared our 2023 Earth Science Data Systems Working Group (ESDSWG) slides! Erin, I can’t wait to see what you do and where you take this all next, and continue to stay connected with us all.\nGrowing our team, we’ve welcomed two new team members: Liz Neeley and Andy Teucher! Both Liz and Andy have backgrounds as environmental scientists, so they are closely connected with researchers and understand deeply the challenges and opportunities as we work with teams, and are huge wonderful additions to the Openscapes Community.\nLiz Neeley brings a deep background of science communication and sense making, and is supporting me as well as NASA Mentors. The first thing we did together is Liz helped design a hiring rubric and interview conversation guides for our cloud position with 26 applicants earlier this year — this is something I had never done before and I learned a lot (blog post upcoming!) Liz is also a founding partner of the new initiative Liminal, which is a science communication collective. I am proud to say that I am part of the collective, alongside some amazing leaders. Liz and I have already co-chaired a workshop with the NIH National Libraries of Medicine, and I shared some of Openscapes’ work in environmental and Earth science communities. I am excited to contribute, learn, connect, and bring back what I learn to the Openscapes community.\nAndy Teucher is a data scientist and open source developer and teacher, and has been focused on cloud infrastructure with NASA Openscapes. In just a few short months already he has identified ways to lower costs for cloud computing and storage. And, making this immediately actionable, he has taught tutorials on technical and policy approaches to reduce costs for scientists and JupyterHub managers, which is so awesome. Andy is continuing to document this and identify other ways to contribute to reduce friction for users learning to access and use NASA Earthdata in the cloud. A current focus is on “fledging” — where do researchers go to do their real science once they have tested whether the Cloud is right for them through our 2i2c JupyterHub? (Look out for a blog post following our July ESIP session!)\nStefanie Butland and Ileana Fenwick and I continue to work closely together, across Openscapes activities. Ileana led the second annual Pathways to Open Science program with co-leads Aneese Williams and Alex Davis earlier this year, reusing what worked and extending the program activities. Ileana, Stef and I led the second year of the Reflections Program as well, and are excited to continue to have new channels and sponsorship so people have friendly entryways to engage with open science. Stefanie has led more and more core activities, doing all setup for Champions Cohorts, teaching lessons, supporting NASA mentors and coworking, and designing and leading the new Quarto + GitHub Contributing Clinic. Look out for Stef’s talk at posit::conf next month about how we use Sean Kross’s Kyber R package to save time and reduce manual errors in Champions Cohorts setup!\nAll of us work closely with Mentors and Champions and others in the greater Openscapes and open science community, and we appreciate you!"

    "section": "STRUCTURE",
    "text": "STRUCTURE\nIn 2022 I started Openscapes LLC as a mechanism to administer funds to support the Openscapes open source community. In my mind, the LLC is not synonymous with all the Openscapes community work described above, it is one piece supporting the community. Openscapes LLC is a value-driven vehicle to try to support open science as a career – a sustainable and lasting career — for myself and for others. An LLC was a mechanism that was possible for me. I do sometimes feel like I have to justify this choice, and I push back on the idea that companies are inherently bad or that non-profits uniquely embody the values of open science (see Chris Hartgerink’s eloquent post about this (Not-)for-profit in research). I see many people wondering how to make open science a sustainable job and we need more pathways – it’s important to be able to explore and discuss mechanisms together as an open community. So how is Openscapes LLC value-driven? We are not motivated by profit. We pay people for their time, we pay quickly, and aim to pay them well. We can work pro-bono at times to collaborate with partners, as we do with the Pathways for Open Science Program and the Tribal Exchange Network Group. We can also donate to causes aligned with our values. Since we believe that open science plays a critical role in climate solutions and justice, we joined 1% for the Planet and starting later in 2024 will donate at least 1% of revenue each year to environmental non-profits. This will be small, but small numbers matter, as does visibly connecting our values with how we work.\nAnd, I am now full time at Openscapes LLC! In May 2024 I shifted to an affiliate position at NCEAS/UC Santa Barbara, after working as a Project Scientist there for 11 years (2013-2024). I love the community and teams at NCEAS - the Ocean Health Index in particular as my open science origins (see 2021 SORTEE slides) along with the admin staff. From undergrad to PhD to NCEAS, I have been at universities since 1999, and this is a big shift for me. And I also feel prepared as I continue developing as a scientist, open science champion, feminist, anti-racist, and human, throughout all these years with all the people I have learned from and worked with along the way. So some underlying structure of my situation has changed, but Openscapes’ momentum is unchanged. \nBeing a small women-owned business owner and designing Openscapes values into the business structure is something I am really proud of. It feels different in some ways compared to being a scientist, but in fact I am solidly both. It has been a lot of work to build and manage a company and I continue to learn really important skills to support the work — and I have not done it alone! I so greatly value my accounting & contracts team, as well as my leadership coach and advisors. And so many practical conversations from people I admire in this community. And, I think that Openscapes LLC is a step. I would like the mechanism to administer funds on the back end to match the community approach on the front end. I am eyeing a collaborative structure in a not-too-distant future, and have talked with some of you about this already (and I am learning from Liminal this way as well). However, we’ll take it one step at a time. We are dedicated and in this for the long-haul: Openscapes LLC is a “keepgoing”, not a startup, to borrow language from open source community lead Greg Wilson."

    "text": "QUESTIONS WE’RE PONDERING\nWe are deeply interested in the “so what” of open science. So teams are more efficient and morale is higher, science is more reproducible, data are more FAIR. So what – is response to wildfires faster, with partners and residents better informed due to open data and sharing? Are communities developing equitable solutions to water management also working on the other side of the world due to trust built and amplified? In my own neighborhood, I see wildfire communications vastly improved because of open data, and groups sharing information and visualizations openly. Fewer neighbors message to ask “where/how big”? And the conversations shift to what to do and how to help each other. This is because they can see the data easily themselves and are informed. I am ready for Openscapes to contribute to stories like these, for the Flywheel to spin for climate and social justice solutions. We’re in a moment where open science is still “new”, shifting from its early adopter moment to the early majority, so it feels early and energizing and new. And, at the same time, people have been working on this for decades, and there is an impatience for us to really gain traction and identify and tell these stories to connect us and unite us in hope and action due to all that we’ve done with open science. It’s about people, and we’re ready.\nI’ll end here for now, thank you for reading. There is so much more learned and on my mind and plate and I look forward to continue collaborating and making a difference with you all. I’m nothing but excited for going forward together.\n\n\n\nLlanwrst, Wales, photo by Julie Lowndes"

    "text": "NASA Champions Cohort Overview\nThe NASA Openscapes Project is a multi-year project to develop a cohesive approach to building Cloud migration capacity across NASA Earthdata from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) and the research teams that the DAACs support. We do this through supporting a community of NASA DAAC mentors, who are primarily dedicated to user support. This community has learned together how to use NASA Earthdata on the Cloud. They have translated that experience into a series of Hackathons, workshops, self-paced tutorial material in the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, and through an intensive, 10-week program: NASA Openscapes Champions.\nCloud migration can often have a steep learning curve and feel overwhelming. The NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort brings together research teams that are interested in migrating their existing NASA Earthdata workflows to the Cloud with NASA DAAC Mentors who are extremely knowledgeable about the data they serve and the initial pathways to using that data on the Cloud. This Cohort provides a common, welcoming place for teams to learn together, ask questions about using the Cloud, plan their transition, and do initial experimentation using the NASA Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub. Because this is a more intensive experience, the teams build collaborative partnerships with DAAC mentors, and the mentors can more quickly identify and work on solving issues that will make Cloud migration easier for many more users. We led the first NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort in 2022.\nThe second NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort ran formally in April-June 2023 with seven research teams interested in a wide variety of NASA Earthdata and various stages of Cloud technology familiarity. You can learn more about their research below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoomie (♥️) of some researchers in the 2023 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort\n\nTogether as a Champions Cohort, these teams discussed what worked and didn’t work as they migrated workflows to the Cloud, focusing on collaboration and open science. We met as a cohort five times over two months on alternating Wednesdays. Each cohort call included a welcome and code of conduct reminder, two teaching sessions with time for reflection in small groups or silent journaling and group discussion, before closing with suggestions for future team meeting topics (“Seaside Chats”), Efficiency Tips, and Inclusion Tips. All topics and the slides presented are shared on the 2023 Cohort page. Additional coworking sessions were scheduled on alternate weeks, where researchers could work quietly, screenshare to ask questions or meet with their team to discuss further. In addition, the teams have access to Openscapes’ 2i2c Jupyter Hub, which will continue for the next year. \nThanks to the NASA Openscapes Mentors for supporting the Champions and for their contributions to the curriculum! In particular, the NASA Openscapes Champions Curriculum had significant additions: \n\nAndy Barrett from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) created a version of Data Strategies for Future Us that is applicable to gridded, remotely sensed data. Slides are here: https://nsidc.github.io/data_strategies_for_future_us/data_strategies_slides#/title-slide \nAmy Steiker and Luis Lopez from NSIDC and Alexis Hunzinger from Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) refactored the Coding Strategies for Future Us to be tailored to NASA Earthdata search, the earthaccess python library, and experiences from teams at Goddard DAAC (GES DISC) that have learned to use the Cloud. \nAmy Steiker from NSIDC designed and led the Earthdata Cloud Clinic! This was a hands-on 1-hour clinic that allowed teams to get familiar with the 2i2c JupyterHub, and practice finding and accessing NASA Earthdata via direct access through two methods from a Jupyter Notebook: earthaccess and Harmony-py services. This material can be found in the cookbook here -&gt; https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/examples/Earthdata-cloud-clinic.html \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Amy Steiker teaching the Earthdata Clinic. We used Zoom’s “green check mark” feature during pauses for people to indicate that they had completed a step.\n\n\nCassie Nickles screenshared and introduced the Earthdata Cookbook and NASA Earthdata Cloud cheatsheets in the final cohort call to help teams understand available resources moving forward."

    "section": "Shared Lessons Learned",
    "text": "Shared Lessons Learned\nThe Openscapes Champions provides a space for teams to come together to learn from each other and across teams. It is a way to collaborate and distribute leadership across teams and reduce the burden on the team leader feeling the need to learn everything first to teach it to the rest of the team. Below are just a few things we’ve learned and are carrying forward. \nUnderstanding ‘When to Cloud.’ The Cloud makes some things easier and some things harder. Over the series of five synchronous cohort calls, we considered when Cloud is effective and when the download model may still be more appropriate. Andy Barrett highlighted some considerations in Call 2 on Data Strategies for Future Us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Andy’s slides.\n\nWhen to Cloud is a recent addition as an early chapter of the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook and will evolve as we continue to learn when to Cloud and when not to. Kudos to Alexis Hunzinger from GES DISC for leading this effort.\nUndifferentiated Heavy Lifting - `earthaccess` for the win! Jeff Bezos coined this term in his 2006 keynote describing AWS doing undifferentiated heavy lifting so that everyone doesn’t have to do the mucky parts. The NASA DAAC Mentors’ work with research teams allows them to identify places of friction that, if fixed once, would benefit many users. One of the places the NASA DAAC mentors, led by Luis Lopez, have done this is with earthaccess, a Python library to search, download or stream NASA Earth science data with just a few lines of code. Luis described earthaccess in a video demo we shared in Call 3, and the Cohort used earthaccess in Call 4. We heard over and over how useful earthaccess was to the Cohort teams. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom chat from a researcher in the 2023 Champions Cohort, who also participated in the 2021 Cloud Hackathon which preceded `earthaccess` development.\n\nHowever, several challenges working with NASA Earthdata in the Cloud are still unresolved. These include: \n\nWe have made the first steps to migrating to the Cloud possible, but workflows are generally designed for serial processing. Refactoring code to take advantage of parallelization and scaling available in the Cloud isn’t a skillset we have on our project team. \nOur Cloud tutorials have been Python-centric, and Champions research teams use a variety of languages, including R, Matlab, IDL, and Fortran. File formats - particularly HDF4 and HDFEOS - that some teams used aren’t as straightforward to use in the Cloud. \nThe 2i2c JuypterHub is a great resource for initial experimentation, but teams do not necessarily want to depend on the Hub. The hurdle to go from accessing the Cloud through a GitHub login in a browser to interacting with the AWS console interface is giant. It also requires a credit card, which leads to the most consistent challenge - it is still difficult to understand how much the Cloud will cost."

    "text": "Gaining Cloud Momentum\nPart of the Openscapes Champions approach is that teams decide what to work on. The teams devoted at least 8 hours a month to focus on their workflows, learning, and collaborating within and across their teams. During this time, they thought through and discussed their current NASA Earthdata workflows and planned and experimented with transitioning their workflows to the Cloud using Openscapes’ 2i2c-hosted Jupyter Hub as a first step. As in other Openscapes Champions cohorts, teams also realized the power of Open science and that open is a spectrum that includes considering future us - potentially just you or your group in 3 months. \nWe saw teams and the NASA DAAC mentors make significant progress in migrating workflows to the Cloud. A few highlights from teams that participated in the cohort included: \n\nThe Geoweaver team made a Python version of Geoweaver, pyGeoweaver, and contributed a tutorial to the EarthData Cloud Cookbook! \nThe CLIMCAPS Team did initial experiments with earthaccess. They found it was a factor of 2 faster, but expected a more significant increase in speed.\nThe HEAT Team was able to access data through earthaccess and bring it into Geopandas. They have additional work to do to use the Cloud to process data to connect to other services like GIOVANNI. \nThe S-MODE Team made initial progress using earthaccess with S-MODE data. They had challenges being able to only access one file at a time. \nThe Hydrometeorology and GESTAR Teams connected with our MathWorks contacts and made progress accessing NASA Earthdata in the Cloud via MATLAB. We’ve submitted a talk at the AGU fall conference about this, stay tuned!\nThe LASERS Team had experience with Google Earth Engine and spent some time trying to use AWS for the same tasks. They also noted how their Cloud collaboration was a pathway toward more open, collaborative work across their team."

While the cohort is officially over, these teams are just at the beginning, and we are excited to follow their results. Several Champions will participate in Carpentries Instructor Training this summer; The Carpentries is a nonprofit that teaches introductory coding skills around the world, Instructor Training is not coding-specific, but it is a pedagogical approach to teaching technical topics. As part of our NASA grant, we partner with The Carpentries and are excited to extend this opportunity to Champions since many of them mentioned wanting to contribute more to open science efforts going forward.\nWe are grateful to this Champion Cohort’s early adopter spirit, their time and effort to make this migration and all of the feedback and input they provided. They all participated in this cohort, knowing that while this was the second Cohort, they were among the first research teams to use NASA Earthdata in the Cloud. What they learned and shared will make it easier for subsequent teams to make this same shift. Many teams articulated this spirit of Open leadership, explicitly asking how they could help other teams. We also learned so much, and we will refine the NASA Openscapes Champions as we plan for our next cohort and our work with the DAAC mentors in the future years of our project."

    "text": "About the NASA Openscapes Champions Teams\nCLIMCAPS Team We use a number of NASA products in CLIMCAPS to stabilize and improve the retrieval of atmospheric profiles from hyperspectral infrared measurements. These include (i) MERRA-2 and (ii) the MEASURES CAMEL dataset. We distribute CLIMCAPS as Level 2 and Level 3 files to a range of different users. Our research focuses on maintaining/improving the CLIMCAPS algorithm and collaborating with users to improve and tailor CLIMCAPS data products. Since releasing the CLIMCAPS record via GES DISC in 2020 (2002–present), we have seen our user base grow. We have had the chance to collaborate with many groups. This gave us the opportunity to address their questions, clarify the product and help prepare custom Level 3 files that are tailored to target applications. The CLIMCAPS Level 2 product contains many different types of uncertainty metrics that can be used to filter and refine data usage. We would absolutely love the opportunity to make these workflows, that we’ve helped develop for users, more widely available. I have no doubt that other communities will find it useful also, and we want, in turn, to learn from others. Experience is teaching us that good science happens when developers and scientists collaborate together. And this is why I think Cloud-based workflows is one of the most exciting technology advances in recent years.\nHEAT (HydroEnergy Analytics Team) There is an increasing global demand for food, water and energy mainly driven by rapid urbanization, rising population, economic growth and regional conflicts. As water, energy and food are interconnected and are part of a system, we will adopt an integrated Water-Energy-Food Nexus (W-E-F) approach to examine the interdependence of water, energy and food and the impacts of climate change on water, energy, and food consumption in Nepal. Nepal, a country located in Southeast Asia, presents a unique case, where the datasets are either sparse, extremely challenging to obtain, or unavailable. Assessing W-E-F Nexus is particularly challenging due to gaps in datasets and lack of long-term observations. NASA’s Earth Observation data can be used to overcome these obstacles by providing ongoing long-term observations of the planet at various spatial and temporal resolutions, effectively filling in the gaps in the data. Our approach involves utilizing data-driven techniques to analyze the W-E-F nexus at watershed level in Nepal. Specifically, we plan to combine NASA’s Earth Observation data with hydropower generation, agricultural production and socioeconomic data in Nepal to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the W-E-F nexus in the region. We have identified several potential datasets, and will address two major questions in the cohort: 1) How has water availability, hydropower generation and consumption, demographics, crop yield changed in Nepal over the last 20 years? 2) What is the relationship between change in hydropower generation with respect to changes in hydrometeorology and demographics? Outcome: We will develop a Jupyter Notebook that outlines a comprehensive method for generating outputs from data acquisition using a Cloud environment. This end-to-end process will be clearly described in the notebook, providing an intuitive and efficient workflow that can be replicated by others adhering to the open science principles. Through this effort, we aim to facilitate the use of Cloud computing in data analysis and dissemination, streamlining the research process and enabling more efficient collaboration among researchers. The final Jupyter Notebook will be shared in the collaborative space (GitHub). The pain points encountered from an interdisciplinary user’s perspective will be documented.\nLASERS Team Our team has expertise in assessing vegetation biophysical parameters using data from all platforms, terrestrial, airborne and spaceborne. We have experience in using the Google Earth Engine and ICESat-2 data to produce gridded-maps of canopy height and canopy cover and we have produced open science software tools for displaying and labeling ICESat-2 photons, e.g., PhotonLabeler, or Waveformlidar, both available on GitHub. Our research efforts of producing Landsat-resolution gridded maps of canopy height, canopy cover, and biomass, are limited in scale by using local computing and data download-intensive approaches. Educational accounts on Cloud-based platforms, such as GEE, have limitations for data availability, data volume and modeling options, and the learning curve and cost for migrating to platforms like AWS, have their own challenges. As such, we hope that by joining NASA’s Openscapes we’ll remove barriers to producing timely vegetation products at continental and global scales to better answer pressing questions in ecology while empowering students and young scientists to use Cloud-computing and open science tools. We use ICESat-2 data, Landsat, and derived data to characterize vegetation structure and estimate biophysical parameters, such as height, cover, biomass. For producing gridded maps of vegetation parameters at scales larger than regional, e.g., continental and global, the volume of data download and processing time are hampering the workflow, therefore we intend to migrate the process to the Cloud.\nGeoweaver Team Our group has a lot of interests and collaboration history with DAACs and the Earth science community, and we are dedicated to developing Geoweaver to support Earth science teams as well as DAAC staff (data pipeline, ingestion, migration, analytics) to be productive, and their work are tangible and FAIR for other scientists to reproduce. We use NASA data as input variables to AI models to train the models with the ability to discover Earth insights in time and be actionable. We are very interested in migrating the workflow into the Cloud because that is where the data is and there are data retrieval and I/O steps in our workflows which are slow if they are executed outside the Cloud. By migrating workflows into Cloud, we want to experiment and showcase that: (1) scientists can easily switch from their personal computing environments to Cloud environment seamlessly and effortlessly using Geoweaver; (2) the hybrid collaboration environment provided by NASA and researchers’ home institution, including their laptops, can work together for one single workflow (/purpose) without under-using (wasting) resources; (3) make the building-testing-debugging iteration more quick, useful, transparent, and of course FAIR (Geoweaver records everything people did no matter where) and help scientists get serious about workflow run history sharing in a single zip file; (4) show that Geoweaver is a click-button solution if scientists want to deploy their AI workflows into operational services to run periodically like every day.\nS-MODE Team Our group has a diversity of professional experience, ranging from graduate students to PI’s. Everyone in our group is interested in exploring open-source workflows on the Cloud and building machinery to analyze a variety of data from S-MODE (Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment). Our collaboration will benefit the general S-MODE community as we plan on sharing our findings. Our overall goal is to foster a data analysis community for S-MODE by creating machinery that can be used by many research groups. From Mackenzie: “I work with NASA funded saildrone data to investigate submesoscale dynamics of the upper ocean and air-sea interactions. Specifically, I am working with saildrone datasets from the Atlantic Tradewind Ocean Atmosphere Interaction Campaign (ATOMIC) and S-MODE. I analyze the saildrone data using python and Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, I use satellite data from SMAP, Aquarius, and SWOT to provide environmental context on where the saildrone data was collected. I currently download most of the datasets and keep them on my university’s HPC system. I use open-source software to analyze the data, which includes python packages such as Xarray, numpy, matplotlib, cartopy, and pandas.”\nHydrometeorology Team We are highly motivated to migrate our ground validation workflow for the NASA GPM - Global Precipitation Measurement product to the Cloud. With over a decade of experience working with ground weather radar products and developing comprehensive workflows for ground validation work, we are eager to streamline and optimize our process. We use NASA data in three areas. First, we conduct cross-validation between NASA GPM products and NOAA ground weather radar products. Second, we create synergy of multiple NASA remote sensing measurements to achieve better precipitation product. Third, we apply NASA remote sensing data to monitor and forecast natural hazards such as flash flooding, drought, tornado, etc. Our team recognizes the numerous benefits that Cloud computing resources can provide. Firstly, Cloud services are highly scalable and can easily accommodate changes in demand from other scientists. Secondly, by migrating our workflow to the Cloud, we can automate many tasks and improve efficiency while reducing the risk of errors or delays. Thirdly, Cloud computing resources are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easier to collaborate with other scientists. Lastly, Cloud services can be integrated with other tools and services, such as machine learning or data analytics platforms, enhancing the overall capabilities of the workflow. We strongly believe that ground validation efforts require a global approach, and migrating our ground validation workflow to the Cloud can greatly enhance our ability to collaborate with other scientists and improve our work on a global scale.\nGESTAR Team We conduct sensor calibration, mission support and support data applications. I work in the GESTAR2 group (Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research II) at UMBC (University of Maryland, Baltimore County). Our team, lead by Dr. Strow with us has been responsible for the development of the CHIRP (Climate Hyperspectral Radiance Product) now being hosted on GES DISC DAAC and intimately concerned with the Aqua AIRS, NOAA CrIS MetOP IASI sensors so that their data can be used for climate studies. We are heavily invested in Matlab with C and Fortran libraries. We deal with 10s of TB data almost daily using the HPC at UMBC - a fantastic resource. There is an interest and growing incentive to migrate to the Cloud, but for us the capital (of effort) to ‘re-locate’ is very significant. We need to understand the cost/benefit in our situation. There is a very steep learning curve and very little time available and there isn’t a one solution to fit all."

    "text": "NASA Champions Cohort overview\nThe NASA Openscapes Framework project is a 3-year project to support scientists using NASA Earthdata from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs), as they migrate workflows to the cloud. We are just wrapping up Year 1 and amazed at how much we have collectively accomplished this year with the DAAC mentors and participating DAACs as well as all the researchers and research teams we have worked with. You can read more about our first year in our 2021 annual report. \nAs part of this work, with the DAAC mentors, we co-led our first NASA Openscapes Champions cohort. Based on Openscapes’ flagship program, Openscapes Champions, theNASA Openscapes Champions Cohort was a professional development and mentorship opportunity for early adopter, science teams that use NASA Earthdata and were interested in migrating their existing workflows to the cloud through collaborative open data science practices. The Openscapes Champions Cohort ran formally in March - April 2022. \nThe ten research teams who participated were interested in a wide variety of NASA Earthdata and various stages of cloud technology familiarity. You can learn more about their research below. Together as a Champions cohort they discussed what worked and didn’t work as they migrated workflows to the cloud, with a focus on collaboration and open science. We met as a cohort five times over two months, on alternating Fridays. Each cohort call included a welcome and code of conduct reminder, two teaching sessions with time for reflection in small groups or silent journaling and group discussion, before closing with suggestions for future team meeting topics (“Seaside Chats”), Efficiency Tips, and Inclusion Tips. Additional hands-on clinics and coworking sessions were scheduled within this period and will extend for the next two months to support these teams as they continue to work on the cloud workflow migration. In addition, the teams were supported by the Openscapes DAAC mentors and staff and Element84 and had access to Openscapes’ 2i2c Jupyter Hub, which will continue for the next year.\n\n\n\nZoomie class photo of NASA Champions"

    "text": "What did participants achieve?\nJust like our DAAC mentors have built collaborative bridges across the distributed data centers to identify the common parts of cloud data access over the first year of our project, this cohort was an opportunity to connect NASA Earthdata users, building a community that is eager to use data in the cloud and provides a forum to discuss common techniques and challenges. The teams devoted at least 8 hours a month to focus on their workflows. In this time, they thought through and discussed their current NASA Earthdata workflows and planned and experimented with transitioning their workflows to the cloud using Openscapes’ 2i2c-hosted Jupyter Hub as a first step. As in other Openscapes Champions cohorts, teams also realized the power of onboarding to create more resilient labs and they explored creating collaborative spaces for their teams through Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub. \nThemes we revisited throughout the cohort included: \nThe Open science underpinnings of the Openscapes Champions program are important. During our last Champions session when the teams presented their pathways, it was amazing to hear how many times that teams were trying to use Github, Gitlab, or taking away other Open science practices in addition to the cloud-specific. It wasn’t all or nothing, they were taking small steps. It was also great to hear that a takeaway from this cohort is, working more openly and reproducibly provides for a more resilient workflow and team. \nWe intentionally focus on providing a kind welcome to technical topics. The kind space that we co-created with the teams and DAAC mentors provided an opportunity to collaborate as teams and ask questions that may in other settings go unasked because of fear that everyone else already knows. (Note: everyone else doesn’t know and will be glad you asked!)   \nThis also led to several challenges that consistently surfaced and still need more focused effort to resolve. The vocabulary to understand the Cloud needs to be clearly explained. For example, what is an S3 bucket or a “requester pays bucket” and why does a user need to know about AWS West-2? Cloud cost is another challenge. We lower the barrier by providing the 2i2c Jupyterhub, but teams don’t want to depend on our hub. They want their own workspace and want to be able to predict costs more effectively. Finally, our work has been focused on Python because that was the language of choice for DAAC mentors and it is a widely used open-source language in the broader Earth science community. In the Champions Cohort we had three teams using Matlab and one team using R; we need to think about how to expand our support and tutorial materials for these other languages."

    "text": "Closing thoughts\nAs we indicated at the beginning of this blog, this transition isn’t one that is completed in 2.5 months and so this is not the end for this Cohort. We are moving from the structured sessions of the Champions program into two additional months of coworking time and 1-1 interactions with DAAC mentors and staff and Element84 in order to make lasting changes with cloud data access. \nWe will focus on specific topics like: \n\nPracticing GitHub workflows and teaching others on your team \nCloud spatial subsetting \nEnvironment management for creating cloud computing space that is reproducible and scalable (e.g. docker images) \nDask/Pangeo software stack to enable scalable processing \nCloud costs and setup \nNetCDF to Zarr\nDocker containers \n\nFinally, we are grateful to this Champion Cohort’s early adopter spirit, their time and effort to make this migration, and all of the feedback and input they provided. They all participated in this cohort knowing that they were some of the first research teams to use NASA Earthdata in the cloud and that they were the first NASA Openscapes Champions cohort. This meant that there would be technical challenges as we work out migrating to the cloud, yet what they learn will make it easier for subsequent teams making this same shift. It also exhibited the reciprocal learning that happens; we will refine the NASA Openscapes Champions as we plan for our next cohort and our work with the DAAC mentors in year 2."

    "text": "NASA Openscapes Champions Teams\nThe Cryosphere Geophysics and Remote Sensing (CryoGARS) Glaciology Team at Boise State University analyzes modern changes to the Earth’s cryosphere, with a focus on rapid changes in glacier flow, glacier-ocean interactions, iceberg melting, and seasonal snow accumulation and melt. Nearly all of our projects use Landsat imagery to map changes in glacier, iceberg, and/or snow extent. Several projects also use Landsat data to map glacier velocities or rely on NASA-produced glacier velocities computed from Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. We also use ICESat-2 data to map glacier volume change and seasonal snow in mountain regions. We look forward to using more cloud resources so that we can expand our analyses in space and time in order to advance our understanding of Cryosphere change!\nThe Mapes Team at the University of Miami studies atmospheric dynamics through multi-source data synthesis, with global grids as the glue. The global grids are huge, so downloading is out of the question. Fetching from aggregations (THREDDS, GDS) works for case studies, but sometimes we need to process it all (simplest example: make a multi-year climatology, to give context to actual fields as “anomalies”). So the data lake in the cloud will be a nice resource, and open new vistas like machine learning which always benefits from more data.\nThe Cornillon Team at the University of Rhode Island has several projects making use of MODIS and VIIRS sea surface temperature (SST). The project of focus for this cohort has been the statistical description of the location, strength, and temporal evolution of SST fronts. As part of this project, we developed an algorithm to unmask pixels improperly flagged as cloud contaminated in the standard MODIS SST products. The improved masks will be made available to the community at large as will the fronts identified by our edge detection algorithm. \nThe Ladies of Landsat Team has members from USGS, UCSB, and the University of Arizona. Kate uses dense time series of Landsat data to build harmonic models to predict land use cover and land use change and its links to climatological signals. Crista and Sarah research the human dimensions of earth observation data, such as Landsat. Nikki uses NASA drought models to map climate hazards in her Navajo Nation community. The research project “Power of the Pixel: Connecting Indigenous Communities through Remote Sensing in the United States” combines the power of all three foci to use NASA/USGS Landsat data to build earth observation capacity in Indigenous communities across the United States.\nThe SASSIE Team has members from the University of Washington, JPL, and APL. They are part of the NASA salinity and SWOT science teams, and regularly use satellite salinity, temperature, altimetry and sea ice data, as well as in situ holdings (SPURS-2, upcoming SASSIE experiment).\nThe Tandon Team at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth uses remotely sensed data to setup the larger scale perspectives for our more in depth analysis and cruise based work for in-situ experimental data from initiatives in the Indian Ocean such as ASIRI and MISOBOB.\nThe Palter Team at the University of Rhode Island uses NASA data to compare with in-situ observations taken from ships and Uncrewed Surface Vehicles. NASA data provides additional parameters (like ocean surface topography) that are useful in the understanding of in-situ data (for example identifying fronts in the ACC). We have also used ocean color data from MODIS-Aqua to map distributions of ocean surface properties, such as chlorophyll concentration & sea surface salinity (region-specific algorithm), to analyze seasonal, annual, and decadal trends of key biogeochemical processes in the ocean.\nThe Just Team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai uses earth observations to reconstruct ground-level environmental exposures to fine particulate matter, air temperature, and humidity which we use in epidemiologic health studies with cohorts and large registries in the US and Mexico. In a project that started out by seeking to understand the pattern of error in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrievals, we have developed an R-based reproducible workflow using the targets package for collocating and correcting AOD from the MAIAC algorithm (product MCD19A2 for Aqua and Terra) versus ground stations using gradient-boosted machine learning. This workflow adds reproducibility and extensibility for further development and new applications, building on results we have published for AOD (https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10050803) and for column water vapor (https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4669-2020; data/code in Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.3568449).\nThe Hain/SPoRT Team is a directly funded NASA activity and engages with operational stakeholders to transition unique NASA observations and capabilities to improve decision-making.\nThe Roberts Team supports evaluation of global energy and water budgets, develops retrieval algorithms and climate data records (e.g. SeaFlux V1), evaluates air-sea interaction and ocean winds, and downscales and bias corrects models for use in hydrologic and agricultural modeling)."

This is a brief post to share resources and a few highlights - we encourage you to review the slides, recording, repos, and notebooks below. Additionally, please join this open science community effort via regular remote hackdays!\nQuicklinks:\n\nslides - slides co-presented by the authors\nrecording\nearthaccess and the cloud: the force awakens notebook - from Luis’ demo\nOpenGeos: NASA-Earth-Data GitHub repository - from Qiusheng’s demo\nleafmap: nasa earth data notebook - from Qiusheng’s demo\nBi-weekly hackdays, Announcement and ongoing discussions for more info.\n\n\nAmy Steiker began the presentation framing the problems that earthaccess addresses: data accessibility, API fragmentation, and authentication in the cloud.\n\n\n\nearthaccess eliminates the need to know the intricacies of NASA’s Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and cloud data storage systems.\n\n\nShe described earthaccess as a community, with roots in the NASA Openscapes community where staff with similar roles supporting users across the DAACs (NASA data centers) have been able to learn, develop common tutorials, and teach together.\n\n\n\nThe earthaccess design came from learning/responding to researcher pain points from cross-DAAC Hackathons and Champions Cohorts\n\n\n\n\n\nThis community strategy is a theme and enabler of earthaccess growth and utilization.\n\n\nAaron Friesz then shared about Earthdata Authentication - Old vs New. The old approach was 30 lines of code, where the user also had to interface with the Earthdata login site. earthaccess now replaces this with 1 line of code. Plus, earthaccess also takes care of AWS credentials.\nLP DAAC uses earthaccess in all of its tutorials and teaching events, including ECOSTRESS and EMIT workshops and hackathons. It has changed the way they work, develop, and teach.\nLuis López, earthaccess lead developer, then shared about scaling in the cloud using earthaccess from a earthaccess and the cloud: the force awakens notebook. He shared how earthaccess interfaces between DAACs-AWS and open science community resources.\n\n\n\nearthaccess interfaces between DAACs-AWS and open science community resources.\n\n\nLuis demo’ed many parts of earthaccess:\n\nAccess remote files, automatically handling authentication and serialization.\nGenerate an on-the-fly Zarr compatible cache with Kerchunk!\nSmart Access - Sneak peak today, more details at SciPy 2024!\nScale out workflows with Dask - Processing Terabyte-Scale NASA Cloud Datasets with Coiled\n\nLuis demo’d upcoming features in development for earthaccess that reduce egress sizes (saves NASA $$) and time to science! This is incredibly exciting!\nEgress:\n without earthaccess: 3199.29 MB \n with earthaccess   :  112.0 MB\n\nTime to science:\n without earthaccess: 15.9 minutes \n with earthaccess   :  0.52 minutes\nQiusheng Wu then shared earthaccess in action with leafmap. Qiusheng built the NASA Earth Data Catalog on top of earthaccess, which uses GitHub Actions to pull the most recent metadata records for NASA Earthdata. Then, using leafmap — Python package for geospatial analysis and interactive mapping in a Jupyter environment that Qiusheng developed — users can interact and view the metadata on a map, exploring and selecting to find the data they want.\nThis is so exciting to have earthaccess involved as the 88th notebook example in the leafmap resource list! You can click to launch the notebook in different coding environments, including Google Colab.\nearthaccess has a lot of momentum moving forward as an open science community, and we welcome you to join our bi-weekly hackdays: fostering new contributions through small group work aligning around specific topics or features.

    "section": "",
    "text": "February through May 2023, Openscapes Mentors from across governments and academia came together for some hands-on learning and practice that had a profound effect on the way we will teach and lead going forward. We learned coaching skills that can help us as professionals – skills like listening rather than solutioneering, asking open-ended questions that empower people to find their own agency and meet their needs. This is a program designed and facilitated by Tara Robertson, a Certified Professional Co-Active and International Coaching Federation Associate Certified Coach. Openscapes has been developing a professional collaborative relationship with Tara since 2021. It was also impactful because it brought together Openscapes Mentors from across government groups (NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, EPA, California Waterboard) so they can learn together and support each other in the 2023 Year of Open Science.\nThis program had a profound impact on the three of us too, as participants as well as program designers and facilitators. We are still trying to define what it was about the program, the process, and everyone involved that led to such a profound sense of trust among us so that we were able to be vulnerable and do courageous things. While these Openscapes Mentors have been collaborating as colleagues together within their organizations (e.g. as NASA Earthdata Mentors or Pathways to Open Science Mentors), this was the first time most of these folks met as a cross-Openscapes mentor community (besides brief encounters at virtual ESIP conference sessions in 2023 and 2022).\nThis truly was a cohort of early adopter “bright spots” - folks who wanted to be better mentors and grow as leaders, even if we didn’t know what that meant yet. Not only were folks working across organizations with other mentors they didn’t know, they were expert scientists being asked to step way outside their comfort zone and be novices. In this setting, they were enthusiastic and fearless learners. There was a really high rate of participation and very few people dropped off over the six sessions. We saw individual growth and impacts feeding back and forth: something introduced gently here that we can practice together makes us comfortable, and now we can take this to other spaces and introduce it gently to others too."

    "text": "Designing a courageous space\nWe connected these bright spots by creating space and place. We met every 2 weeks for 6 remote sessions for a total of 12 hours. Twenty-eight people participated as part of their paid jobs, supported by their organizations rather than doing it “off the side of their desk”. We used a practice already familiar to all Openscapes Mentors: collaborative note-taking Agendas all in one Google doc where we had a shared responsibility to take notes, clarify explanations, add links to resources, and add shared joy and encouragement via emojis, +1’s and comments. We co-designed and helped each other when facilitating, which was instrumental when Tara got sick and lost her voice and Julie stepped in to facilitate the session based on Tara’s prep ahead of time.\nThe 6 sessions focused on specific topics: powerful questions, 3 levels of listening, identifying values, leader within, saboteurs and then taking these coaching skills into mentoring, supervising and sponsoring. For each of the topics, Tara briefly described the topic or skill, did a live demo with one of the participants, and the group described what they observed. Then, Tara gave us a topic to coach on, or some guardrails, and participants went into breakout rooms in pairs to practice coaching and being coached.\nThere was a lot of hands-on doing. Most of the participants said this was the best part of the course and also the most uncomfortable bit. In these pairs, the coaches were learning how to ask questions that help people open up…and this also challenged the coachees, who really dived into their needs and blockers for how to better support open science. It was also a testament to Tara’s own willingness to be vulnerable, demonstrating as a coachee and giving us her own real-life examples.\nThoughts from Tara: Something really special happened with this cohort. There were three main ingredients to this magic:\n\nThe participants were enthusiastic and fearless learners who were willing to step outside their comfort zones and learn new things together. This group of expert scientists from different organizations were willing to be beginner learners with each other. This group embodied courage.\nWe were intentional in the design to maximize psychological safety. At the start of Week 1 we designed an alliance together on how we wanted to be and learn together. I ordered the topics to start with the lower stakes topics and we were intentional about mixing people up across organizations. In the week 5 coaching demo one of the coaching demos the coachee chose to be quite vulnerable and bring a real challenge. This was a turning point where we saw that we can use these skills to surface challenging topics and have honest conversations about barriers in science.\nOpenscapes investment in coaching skills was a unique way to collectively learn some new skills AND build connections between open science leaders across different organizations and Openscapes initiatives: Mentors at NOAA Fisheries, NASA and from the growing Mentor community from CalEPA and Pathways to Open Science."

    "text": "Building skills for listening not solutioneering\nSo called “soft skills” are anything but. This was hard. Learning to ask open ended questions was hard, and what was harder still was listening to be able to ask the next powerful question. How we listen differs whether we are in mentor-mode or coach-mode:\n\nWhen we listen as mentors, we’re trying to understand where our expertise can help someone solve a problem.\nWhen we’re listening as coaches, we’re trying to help the other person define their problem, and tap into their own wisdom to find their solution, likely outside of our domain expertise.\n\nWhat do we mean by a “powerful question”? It’s a short question that can open up a really powerful conversation. It’s open-ended, usually starts with the word “What”, ideally is 5 words or less, and can’t be answered by yes or no. What feels like success to you? What’s in the way? What, if anything, is going unsaid? Which of your core values is being messed with?\nDistinguishing when we’re listening as mentors and when we’re listening as coaches is important, because it determines how we will respond as early adopters who may not know the answer to the question – think cloud computing, how to store increasingly large data, how to give hard feedback to a superior, and how to ask for help in a culture built on competition and the myth of the lone genius. Developing these coach listening skills, including what questions to ask, has helped us help others better (and notice and avoid solutioneering!). It’s also helped us feel less overwhelmed as we learn that it’s okay to not always have the answer!\n\n\n“We need these coaching skills to do powerful work and inspire meaningful connections; this program is a safe space to learn, to challenge our preconceptions, to practice, and to grow. I found it to be so invaluable because it’s a chance to acknowledge and learn about skills that are often unspoken in their ability to improve mentorship and collaboration.” — Ileana Fenwick\n\n\nThoughts from Stef. During the first two sessions, in the breakout rooms to practice coaching in pairs, I defaulted to talking more about the process and how we felt about it because actually practicing coaching, even with specific prompts, felt really really hard. But somehow over time, it got easier. Now I find myself trying out “powerful questions” with my peers in one-to-one conversations or coworking, rather than my usual behavior of suggesting solutions to people’s challenges. And people seem to respond!\nBut what really made this work?\n\nPeople were primed for this based on their prior experiences as Openscapes Mentors. They came expecting a familiar set of norms and psychological safety that allowed them first to get comfortable and then to take risks. With this foundation, together we were able to build trust early on. This is key to developing healthy teams and communities. We all knew it would be worth it even if we didn’t know what we were getting into.\nOften, to offer a program like this, an organization might contract an external professional to deliver it. We took it a step further. Openscapes contracted Tara, with whom we’ve collaborated before, and who is highly respected for her tell-it-like-it-is approach to diversity and inclusion. The core team of Tara, Julie, and me, worked to onboard ourselves and each other to this process using an open facilitation approach rather than working behind a curtain. We met frequently and defined our roles together, agreeing to role-model transparency and vulnerability and to name these things. Julie and I took turns managing breakout rooms each week so we could also take turns practicing coaching.\nThe mentors were not our students; they’re our peers and collaborators. Once people opted in, there was no judgment or “sorries” if someone was late or had to miss a session because of life’s responsibilities.\nPractice! We moved away from analyzing and into the doing. It was uncomfortable and people still came and showed up as leaders"

    "text": "Building mindsets as leaders\nDeveloping coaching skills also helped us build new mindsets. There was a braveness that grew throughout our time together that showed up in different ways. One person shared that they are more brave with whom/when/where they might interact as a coach and mentor. They had recently found themselves in-person with someone senior and rather than making nervous small talk found themselves asking powerful questions and really connecting with the senior person more, and felt that they both learned something in this short moment together.\nWe grew these new mindsets with our peers and built trust and community in a really profound way. The topics people surfaced and shared were so vulnerable – navigating racism, personal and structural saboteurs, and the integrations of personal and work life. We had never experienced such vulnerability in our work, and knew we could not shy away from difficult topics but needed to dig further and out based on the courage and trust in the room.\nThoughts from Julie. I’ve talked a lot about the impact of open data science on my career and my life. My science thinking was transformed when I realized I could do an analysis just as easily 100 times with a for-loop as doing it twice, and that I could publish my work via RMarkdown and GitHub to the open web and share via a single URL instead of sending followup emails with different versions of the same PDF or Word doc. Now, I am realizing that the impact of coaching on my thinking might be at this same level. I am still processing it all, but I am feeling more confident in places I have been struggling to show up as my full self. It is somehow helping me bring confidence into a room with me, knowing that I have new skills and a strengthened sense of shared braveness together with this cohort. When we first planned this cohort with Tara, this was new terrain. We asked ourselves, “If this is wildly successful what are the outcomes? What’s possible?“ Here are some ideas we laid out, and I think the Mentors are meeting each one:\n\nPeople model inclusive behavior in work, life, Openscapes, and our home organizations, to influence culture change\nPeople are braver, share stories and energy at work and other places\nSomeone speaks up in a meeting\nEveryone learns something new! (me too!)\nWe listen better/differently\nWe scale participation - use coaching strategies to empower others sooner, so that existing mentors don’t burn out\nMore people feel safe in Openscapes and open science, and in turn, inspire others to be braver"

    "text": "Fearless in service of something\nWorking with Tara and bringing Openscapes Mentors across different organizations and initiatives is part of movement building with our Flywheel. This is a concept developed by Jim Collins that we adapted for Openscapes with Erin Robinson (Erin first brought coaching into Openscapes strategy and practices too!). Transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time. Using this model, we welcomed folks to opt in, created space and place so we could invest in learning and trust, and then worked openly together as we practiced as coaches and coachees, leveraging common experiences and skills. This turn of the flywheel is part of building the momentum of kinder and open science, building from past, parallel, and collaborative work from many places. Mentors are already inspiring others with their leadership, pushing the next turn of the flywheel.\nBravery has come up throughout this cohort and this post, and this braveness and fearlessness is in service of something. We’re wanting to connect our daily work with the global moment at hand, so we can better address issues stemming from climate change and social justice. As one participant said, “I don’t want to be scared to ask questions anymore”. We want to ask questions with no ego, in rooms with our science peers. We want to break the silences, opening up the rooms so that the next person who has a question but was not sure they would voice it is empowered to speak up.\nIn our final session we paired up to coach each other through developing our own statement of purpose in open science.\n\n\n“I am an elevator to a better tomorrow”\n\n\n\n\n\n“I am a pollinator who connects people to each other and ideas so everyone flourishes”\n\n\n\n\n\n“I am the momentum that answers to my peers”\n\n\n\nWe are all the momentum that answers to our peers. To make meaningful change, we must work across all levels and elevate those who will be the change along with us.\n\n ::: {.caption-text .center-text} Photo by Elliot Lowndes :::"

We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science3, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\nOpenscapes Champions is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. For NASA Openscapes, research teams will also spend time experimenting and planning what their analytical workflows with NASA Earthdata look like in the Cloud. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/ Python/ MATLAB, JupyterHub, GitHub, metadata, cloud), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.\nNASA Openscapes is a project to support scientists using data from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud. As part of this work, we will offer the Openscapes Champions program several times from 2024-2026."

(2 Empower): Mentors have led 10 Workshops: internal with DAAC staff and external with researchers; developed the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook; Reused tutorials, slides, graphics and facilitation and open practices; were more aware cross-DAAC, less recreating; from user feedback developed Cheatsheets and the earthaccess python library; wrote the Value of Hosted JupyterHubs (White paper RFI); Collaborating on Hackweeks, 2i2c cont’d access after workshops. (3 Amplify): Mentors are amplifying across-DAACs and beyond: Career advancement & bringing mindset to new places; Speaking up in other meetings (User Needs TIM, TRAIN, Cloud Playground); Connecting & consulting based on experiences - Pathfinder for 2i2c, comparing w/ SMCE; AWS; Engaging beyond (Pangeo Forge, Ladies of Landsat, pyOpenSci)."

    "text": "Why NASA Earthdata? Why Openscapes?\nWe are getting these questions a lot, so here is our take.\nNASA Earth Science Data Systems missions collect Earth data, including sea ice, physical oceanography, vegetation and many other parameters – data used by researchers around the world for many different purposes, including answering pressing questions in ecology and environmental science. Further, NASA promotes open science – from the NASA Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program 2020 Highlights report:\n\nOpen data are the foundation of ESDS efforts to fulfill the program’s vision of accelerating scientific advancement for societal benefit through innovative Earth science data stewardship and technology development….to leverage the diversity of global Earth science communities to advance open science.\n\nOpenscapes’ long-term goal is to enable robust, inclusive, and enduring science- and data-driven solutions to global and time-sensitive challenges. We approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. We see data analysis and stewardship as entryways to meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skill sets and mindsets while empowering them as leaders. With NASA support, the project team and the partners, the Openscapes Framework fundamentally changes the paradigm for supporting research teams and DAAC mentors, first to work more openly with their teams on the cloud, and ultimately to advance open science!\nOpenscapes is co-directed by project leads Lowndes and Robinson, and operated at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), University of California Santa Barbara."

They deploy community-driven infrastructure, inspired by use-cases such as the UC Berkeley DataHubs and the Pangeo project, that provides easy “one-click-to-cloud” access with Jupyter Notebooks through the web browser designed to reduce the startup burden for new learners, and this approach will also benefit the NASA DAAC community."

We meet and learn together, working with alignment on common needs for researchers using NASA Earthdata. Mentors receive Carpentries Instructor training and Openscapes mentorship to help you refine teaching strategies for Cloud, while collaborating on cloud tutorials to reuse rather than reinventing separately. Mentors teach and support in opportunities of different types: Hackathons, Workshops, and the Openscapes Champions program. We expect a range of technical ability and teaching experience. Through these growth opportunities within a broader community engagement approach, Mentors will also gain visibility for their work as well as for their DAACs. The expected time commitment is 3 days/month per year (and this ebbs and flows with your deadlines). We have 1.5 hour Mentor Calls (planning) every 2 weeks and Coworking calls (screensharing and doing) and asynchronous work in between. The majority of your time will be spent self-directed towards improving support approaches for specific DAACs, and you’ll be collaborating with others at your DAAC as well as across DAACs and the broader open science community.\nPlease also see how we onboard documentation – this is part of the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook that is the main place for all cloud resources the Mentors are developing."

We kickoff those calls with about 10 mins of check in and agenda design and then we will move to proposed topics, including professional development skills like coaching. In alternating weeks, we have Coworking sessions to work on shared goals together, screensharing and often working in the 2i2c JupyterHub and in GitHub. Hackdays are additional times set to advance our four specific focus areas above.\n\n\nCalendar\nCoworking sessions & hackdays are open to anyone to join; see our MainPlanning GitHub Project.\n\nWinter & Spring - We have twice-monthly Mentor Calls and Coworking sessions in alternating weeks. February-May focused extended Hackday sessions with focus listed above.\nSpring Champions Cohort - We will support 7-10 research teams to learn, discuss, and plan what transitioning their workflows with NASA Earthdata could look like in the Cloud.\nSummer and ESIP meeting - In July and August we planned to take a break from our biweekly calls to let this group rest. However, there was interest to keep the momentum and ability to collaborate with anyone available, so we have continued to host biweekly calls and move forward with AGU workshop proposals, and have guest speakers. In July many Mentors met in person at the ESIP Summer Conference in Vermont, including for a one-day retreat-workshop to shape sustainability plans for the group.\nFall - We onboard new mentors; we will have our first Mentor Call with the full group of mentors - to introduce everyone and orient around the NASA Openscapes project. Our initial call will include sharing plans, UWGs and other events on the calendar and continuing onboarding new DAAC mentors. In preparing for AGU workshops in December, returning DAAC mentors will lead teaching dry runs with the cloud tutorials as a way to onboard the group to data access in the cloud and to get your fresh perspective on our existing material.

As part of this effort we are openly developing the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook: a compilation of open source tutorials, workflows, and cheatsheets that we have refined through teaching over 20 Cloud workshops with researchers using NASA Earthdata. We support NASA Earthdata users by developing an open science mindset focused on kindness and inclusion, as well as developing software to reduce time to science and meet researchers where they are. The earthaccess library and corn base image helps researchers access NASA Earthdata in a few lines of code – in Python, R, and MATLAB. We will share about this ongoing work and how we collaborate to share lessons learned and tackle challenges together - and welcome you to join the open science movement."

    "text": "The NOAA Enterprise Data Management Workshop (EDMW) is an annual workshop organized by NOAA staff and affiliates. The purpose of the workshop is to build on past work in enterprise data management at NOAA by highlighting progress, identifying issues, fostering discussions, and determining where new technologies can be applied. This year’s theme is “Bridging the Gap: Ensuring Seamless Data Flow from Acquisition to Access”\nNASA Openscapes was invited to present via Bri Lind (NASA Land Processes data center, LP DAAC). Julie Lowndes (Openscapes) & Ian Carroll (NASA Ocean Biology data center, OB.DAAC) will co-present.\nHow the NASA Openscapes community supports Earthdata users migrating workflows to the Cloud\nAbstract: NASA Openscapes is a community where staff with similar roles supporting users across 12 NASA Earth Science Data Centers (DAACs) have been able to learn, develop common tutorials, and teach together to support users migrating workflows to the Cloud. NASA Openscapes Mentors co-create and maintain an open Earthdata Cloud Cookbook of common reusable open source tutorials that they have co-developed for specific audiences and tested and refined through frequent workshops, hackathons, and Openscapes Champions Cohorts. They also created the earthaccess Python library which made users’ first experience with NASA Earthdata Cloud be two lines of Python code rather than 30 lines of bash code (that also required clicking and managing hidden files for authentication). The work these Mentors do together as a small community has enormous cascading effects, particularly as they visibly practice open science daily via contributions to open source code and documentation. Further, they are connected to other open communities to enable further innovation: like when a conversation at the Ecological Society of America conference led to building the earthdatalogin R library to support researchers R as well as Python and create portable docker containers cloud users. We will share stories and how we work, and how approaches fit and can be leveraged by the NOAA Enterprise Data Management community."

This workshop had 250 participants, and this frictionless approach involved sharing a link for access (like you would with Zoom/Teams) rather than requiring participants to create and share GitHub usernames in advance (and workshop hosts to manage and add them to the Hub).\nWe will be continuing to use this approach for large workshops going forward, and have added instructions for workshop leads to the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook - Policies & Admin section.\n \n\nOur partners 2i2c host our NASA Openscapes JupyterHub as part of their mission to support open science and building communities in the cloud using interactive computing.

The goals of this session were to hear from and boost a diverse set of leaders from across the US government and academia to highlight open science in daily work, including peer-teaching, mentoring, and learning. Building from our session at ESIP Winter 2022, we hope to create more channels for inter- and cross-agency learning, and share open science stories across agencies, as part of the 2023 Year of Open Science as recently declared by the US Biden-Harris Administration. Speakers shared stories about open science in government and their experiences with Openscapes. Stories were shared in a “Fishbowl” format, where speakers each shared and then there was a broader discussion with the 50+ participants. This blog is co-authored with the speakers.\nQuick links:"

    "text": "3 approaches for the year of open science\nThis session brought together a diverse set of leaders from across the U.S. government and academia to highlight open science in daily work, including peer-teaching, mentoring, and learning. They shared stories, examples, and concrete tips for supporting each other and our colleagues with collaborative, inclusive open science approaches, with the aim of strengthening channels for inter- and cross-agency action in the Year of Open Science 2023. This session builds from our session at ESIP Winter 2022, and you can review the summary blog and videos: 3 takeaways for planning for the year of open science. Those 3 takeaways were 1. Both top-down and grassroots efforts are necessary; 2. Dissolve silos by supporting early adopters; 3. Reuse and build from existing efforts to accelerate change.\nThis year, presenters shared Openscapes stories and approaches following another year’s work mentoring, coaching, and teaching colleagues as well as listening, advocating, and informing open science policy at different levels. Their stories come from the many phases of open science movement building they represent: a first welcome, inside government organizations, “forking” Openscapes internally, and contributing back to open science. What emerged was real lightbulb moments and real-time interplay between panelists who have not previously worked together as we recognized common themes and learned from each other.\nHere are 3 overlapping takeaways from this session that all speakers embodied:\n\nExamine the cracks; invest in real relationships\nBreak the hero mentality in science; invest in radical collaboration\nBuild morale through learning; advocate for learning time\n\nWe describe these more fully below. And as we advocate for open science in this Year of Open Science, let’s connect open science with building morale and empowering individuals as well as with the higher quality of work created."

    "section": "Examine the cracks; invest in real relationships",
    "text": "Examine the cracks; invest in real relationships\n“Examining the cracks’’ was a concept brought up by Ileana Fenwick at the very beginning of our session, and it resonated with the other panelists throughout. Ileana designed and leads the Pathways to Open Science program, a remote event series of community calls and coworking for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. The first session, held on the evening of this ESIP panel, welcomed over 80 participants! Ileana shared that as she became empowered with open science, she thought exposure alone would be enough to attract other people to open science events. It wasn’t; there are many reasons why folks do not feel included in science and open science. It caused her to examine the cracks - why wouldn’t she participate in this program if she saw it in her inbox? This influenced the design of the Pathways program, with a deep investment in engagement. Ileana partnered Openscapes with Black in Marine Science (BIMS) and Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS), and met 1:1 with faculty at HBCUs, to learn about their students’ needs and introduce her ideas for the program. Ileana shared these three pieces of advice, saying”inclusion is not an afterthought”:\n\nSurface level efforts are easy to spot. Some questions to ask as you plan your program goals and efforts are: What is your motivation for this work? Is it genuine? Is the space you’re inviting students to a safe space for marginalized students? (Do they know that?) It is clear when the broader impacts are written last. Inclusion is not an afterthought, your planning and process should demonstrate that.\nWe exist. If your efforts are not yielding diverse participation, it’s not because we aren’t out there. It’s because your efforts need to be tailored more specifically and intentionally.\nCenter diverse voices. If there are no members of your team from your target audience or your team is not reflective, this is a moment to step back and ask yourself if YOU need to be the one doing this work. Amplify and empower diverse leadership, support them, compensate them, use privilege to push the project forward.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSlide from Ileana Fenwick’s talk on challenging her views on how to engage. Examining the cracks led Ileana to see that that exposure to information is not enough, and this influenced the design of the Pathways to Open Science program\n\n\nLater, Corey Clatterbuck described the momentum at the California Water Boards following an Openscapes Cohort she and Anna Holder co-led in 2022. They knew they wanted to “fork” the Openscapes curriculum to adapt it to the needs of their colleagues, so they examined the cracks using results of an internal 2019 Data Literacy Survey with Water Boards employees. Corey and Anna were surprised by the results and, like Ileana, designed their programming to meet these needs. The results showed that respondents were motivated by interest in particular data tasks (image below, top half) and not in specific software or coding languages (image below, bottom half). In short, people were more interested in learning how to do things in their job (goal-oriented), than learning specific software (tool-oriented). From this, the design of their Cohort emphasized the human over technical approach to open science to reach the majority of Water Boards colleagues who might be interested in open science. They increased the length of each call from 1.5 hours to 2 hours, and added a new module on documentation to replace the one on coding-strategies.\n\n\n \n\n\nResults from the California Water Boards internal 2019 Data Literacy Survey showed that respondents were motivated by interest in particular data tasks (top half) and not in specific software or coding languages (bottom half). Examining these cracks influenced how Clatterbuck and Holder forked and designed the Champions Program at the California Water Boards. (slide from Clatterbuck)\n\n\nIleana’s approach of “Examining the cracks” also caught Cassie Nickles’ ear. She is a Mentor with NASA Openscapes, a community that supports researchers as they migrate analytical workflows to the Cloud. Cassie and her colleagues across other NASA Earthdata data centers are co-creating common tutorials, a review & reuse process, and as well as community of practice for teaching, mentoring, and facilitation for NASA Earthdata Cloud. As she was onboarding into her current role, Cassie became overwhelmed by the steps and processes required by end users to access and use NASA Earthdata. She figured if she was confused, others might be too and wanted to help simplify navigating the complicated systems.\n\nThe data analysis needed for the pressing problems we face should not be limited by the complexity of the underlying systems or a lack of computer engineering skills. - Luis Lopez, NSIDC\n\nCassie and Openscapes Mentor-colleague Catalina Oaida Taglialatela made Cheatsheets with clickable icons that lead to tutorials for NASA Earthdata Cloud researchers! Having filled some gaps, Cassie is now recognizing more cracks moving forward: how do we get these resources in front of the folks they’re intended for?"

    "section": "Break the hero mentality in science; invest in radical collaboration",
    "text": "Break the hero mentality in science; invest in radical collaboration\nErin Robinson opened the session saying that solutions to large-scale environmental and social challenges require radical collaboration, but have been limited by the hero model, where science is competitive, siloed, and rewards an individual hero, often a white man. She said we together are changing this story. We do this by welcoming people where they are and through creative approaches that blend methods from open source software development, mentoring, coaching, and art.\nReflecting as a Mentor at NOAA Fisheries supporting 6 Openscapes cohorts (240 staff) in 2022, Josh London said that “collaboration is something we’re never taught.” Individuality is instilled in grad school and we never have a chance to change this through “business as usual.” We need the space and place to relearn. Don’t spend your time trying to solve things yourself. Learn together first! It’s ok to ask for help early. Adyan Rios is also a NOAA Fisheries Mentor, who is helping develop a learning culture at the Southeast Fisheries Science Center through leading “Surf Sessions” where colleagues cowork remotely and share what they know. Adyan echoed this need for radical collaboration, saying that it’s radical because it means being vulnerable. It means people sharing things they haven’t figured out yet, while they’re still messy. Or share a cool thing you learned, like a keyboard shortcut. If you just learned it, chances are someone in your community didn’t know it yet either. Sharing makes their day a little better and make their work more efficient. This harkens back to Cassie creating cheatsheets to share what she figured out to help others.\n\n\n“Team collaboration is not something that we’ve all learned from the beginning. In grad school it’s instilled in us this idea that anything meaningful that we do in science is supposed to be done by us as individuals.” – Josh London\n\n\n\n\n\n“This mindset and practice [of learning together first] has been revolutionary for us at NOAA.” — Adyan Rios\n\nBreaking the hero model is something that Luis Lopez has been thinking about too. He shared that as a software engineer, something he has learned through the NASA Openscapes Mentors community is to empathize with researchers and not expect that software alone is the hero. The key is to really understand learners and researchers, get to know them and see how they work and where they are stuck. Working with his NASA Mentor colleagues, Luis identified that there were many steps involved before researchers could be hands-on with data in the cloud, and was intent on reducing that “time to science”. Luis has led development of the earthaccess python library to search, download or stream NASA Earth science data, enabling a researcher to get to the science with four lines of Python code, instead of running command line code that saves a hidden .netrc file to the user’s computer and requires reactivation after one hour. Collaborating with other Mentors has been critical here – again breaking the hero model – as Cassie’s Cheatsheets helped visualize all the steps previously involved that were cumbersome for scientists.\n\nBuild morale through learning; advocate for learning time\n“How to make learning part of your job” and “When do you carve out time to learn” are questions that come up frequently, as they did here. Pointing to examples of how other individuals and agencies do this has been super powerful: it is negotiated with supervisors at NOAA to be included in Individual Work Plans, and the NASA Earthdata Mentors are a fantastic example of the power of high-level support for learning. The NASA Mentors shared how the Mentor community has been able to learn and collaborate together over the past two years. This was because their time was approved at a high level, by NASA policy and by their managers. This approved time has given space for them to first share and listen, find the common, and then build together, reuse, and amplify.\n\n\n“Learning builds morale: it gives people an opportunity to change workflows, learn new skills, improve the culture, and take ownershipof that” — Josh London\n\n\nWe’re seeing some of this trickle out beyond the Openscapes curriculum. Josh London talked about how we often focus on the shiny new tools (python, R, Quarto, GitHub) but it’s the culture shifts that are the real meaningful change. He said it’s so encouraging to see in a calendar invite for a meeting that someone’s already initiated an agenda in a shared document and that there are multiple people contributing notes there at the same time. Additionally, learning to use tools like GitHub for shared “todo” lists and better project management for teams has increased morale for NOAA Fisheries teams. Teams are also using these tools for more inclusive communication to onboard other team members to their projects, passing forward this increased morale that comes from learning together.\nLoneliness during the Pandemic was mentioned several times - Adyan, Cassie, Corey, and Ileana all onboarded to their current roles during the pandemic. They noted that shared practices like coworking along with collaborating asynchronously with GitHub and Google Docs helped them feel less alone and build real connections with their colleagues. And, it helped them learn skills they needed to do their jobs. They saw that these skills would help other colleagues as well, so they have dedicated time to teaching and supporting colleagues, and advocating for learning time from supervisors.\n\n\n“Not everyone needs the same learning curve; we can send down a rope and help others get to where they need to be sooner.” — Adyan Rios\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe California Water Boards Openscapes Cohort emphasized psychological safety and culture, uniting data strategies, and documentation to create a welcoming environment, build community, and reduce loneliness in learning new skills. (slide from Clatterbuck; artwork from GitHub Illustrated Series)\n\n\n\nOnward\nOne of the most inspiring aspects of this panel was the mutual recognition of common themes, challenges, and potential approaches among speakers from government agencies and academia who had not previously worked together. ESIP is a great place to make those connections across agencies and convening these sessions is an effective way to move us all forward together. Open science isn’t the ultimate goal. The vision is what’s possible because of open science: climate solutions, social justice, and democracy. As we advocate in this Year of Open Science, let’s connect it not just to the higher efficiency and quality of work that is produced, but especially with higher team morale and empowerment of individuals to change their institutional culture.\n\n\n\nSpeakers Bios\nCorey Clatterbuck is an environmental scientist at the California Water Boards in the Office of Information Management and Analysis and the Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program.

If you do it yourself, this involves creating an AWS Account, connecting to an EC2 instance, and using resources like the Earthdata Cloud Primer for more setup and cost management information. If you use a managed Cloud service, organizations like 2i2c can provide Cloud-hosted JupyterHubs for research and education. Your institution may also support smaller or larger scale options."

Amy Steiker and Luis Lopez lead a live demo for UWG participants, leveraging the same Google doc approach used during the Science Champions Earthdata Cloud Clinic for this event, including more information on Coiled. \n\n\nAmy Steiker presenting to NSIDC User Working Group\n\nThe demo showcased a Python script that processed large amounts of altimetry data from NASA’s ICESat-2 mission. While the script was run from Amy’s local computer, the data processing steps were run on the Cloud using Coiled Functions for running Python functions on Cloud virtual machines (VMs). This approach was particularly convenient as it allows existing Python functions to be run in the Cloud by lightly annotating them with a @coiled.function decorator.\nThis workflow benefited from running on the Cloud because the ICESat-2 mission data was already stored on the Cloud in S3, so moving the data processing to be co-located next to the data avoided data transfers, which are both slow and expensive."

This is important not only because it helps us develop collaboratively as a team, but it’s also the same technology that Earth science researchers use, so we are able to develop practical experience to help them every day as we work. It made sense to explore using GitHub more deeply for our planning and calendaring. \nWe started using GitHub as a centralized place where any of the ~40 NASA Openscapes Mentors can post dates and information for a conference workshop they are leading, for example. Everyone else can see it, and someone might comment “I’m speaking at the same conference. I can give some hands-on help.”, or “Here’s a python notebook I created for a similar workshop last month.” During the Community Call, Stef screenshared our MainPlanning GitHub Project, the Roadmap view (screenshot below) that gives a calendar perspective and the Table view for details on each item. She demo’d creating a GitHub Issue, associating it with the Project, adding topic labels, and a Start date to have it appear in the Roadmap. She showed how we’re also documenting this as we go with screenshots in NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook - GitHub for Calendaring and Project Management.\n\n\n\nRoadmap view of a GitHub Project for NASA Openscapes Mentors and collaborators"

This is cheap.\nWe bring this cost down further to $0.36 with the following techniques:\n\nSpot: Use spot instances, which are excess capacity offered at a discount.\nARM: Use ARM-based instances, which are less expensive than their Intel-based equivalents, often with similar, or better, performance.\nInstance Type Selection: Use single-core instances (only available when using ARM), because this particular computation doesn’t require large computing resources.\n\nWith this additional configuration made to the Coiled Functions decorator, our full cost-optimized cloud workflow looks like the following:\nimport os\nimport tempfile\nimport coiled\nimport earthaccess\nimport numpy as np\nimport xarray as xr\n\n# Step 1: Get a list of all files.\n#         Use earthacess to authenticate and find data files (total of 500 GB).\ngranules = earthaccess.search_data(\n    short_name=\"MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1\",\n    temporal=(\"2020-01-01\", \"2021-12-31\"),\n)\n\n\n# Step 2: Create a function to process each file.\n#         Load and subset each data granule / file.\n@coiled.function(\n    region=\"us-west-2\",                  # Run in the same region as data\n    environ=earthaccess.auth_environ(),  # Forward Earthdata auth to cloud VMs\n    spot_policy=\"spot_with_fallback\",    # Use spot instances when available\n    arm=True,                            # Use ARM-based instances\n    cpu=1,                               # Use Single-core instances\n)\ndef process(granule):\n    results = []\n    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:\n        files = earthaccess.download(granule, tmpdir)\n        for file in files:\n            ds = xr.open_dataset(os.path.join(tmpdir, file))\n            ds = ds.sel(lon=slice(-93, -76), lat=slice(41, 49))\n            cond = (ds.sea_ice_fraction &lt; 0.15) | np.isnan(ds.sea_ice_fraction)\n            result = ds.analysed_sst.where(cond)\n            results.append(result)\n    return xr.concat(results, dim=\"time\")\n\n\n# Step 3: Run function on each file in parallel\nresults = process.map(granules)     # This runs on the cloud in parallel\n\n\n# Step 4: Combine and plot results\nds = xr.concat(results, dim=\"time\")\nds.std(\"time\").plot(figsize=(14, 6), x=\"lon\", y=\"lat\")\nand, while code runtime stays the same at ~9 minutes, cost drops to ~$0.36 (a factor of ~70x less than running locally)."

This demonstrated the following:\n\nEasy: Minimal code changes to migrate existing code to run on the cloud.\nFast: Acceleration of the workflow runtime by ~42x.\nCheap: Cost reduction of ~70x.\n\nWe hope this post shows that with just a handful of lines of code you can migrate your data workflow to the cloud in a straightforward manner. We also hope it provides a template you can copy and adapt for your own analysis use case.\n\n\n\n\nComparing cost and duration between running the same workflow locally on a laptop (data egress costs), running on AWS, and running with cost optimizations on AWS.\n\n\n\nWant to run this example yourself?\n\nGet started with Coiled for free at coiled.io/start. This example runs comfortably within the free tier.\nCopy and paste the code snippet above.\n\nGoing to AGU 2023? Come by the Coiled booth and say hi (right by the entrance next to Google)."

    "text": "Easy Scalable Cloud Computing with Coiled\nThe call started with a few demos, first from Andy Barrett and Amy Steiker from NSIDC. Andy shared a science use case based on translating photons measurements from ICESAT-2 to sea ice thickness. These data were first accessed with the earthaccess Python library, then needed to be regridded over geographic areas, which Amy demoed in this Jupyter notebook. Amy ran this code on her laptop and used Coiled to spin up remote virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud to run her computations.\n\n\n\nThen, James ran through two common workflows that process terabyte-scale cloud datasets. In the first example, we saw how to churn through many cloud-hosted NASA Earthdata files (~500 GB of NetCDF files) in parallel on the cloud. This involved lightly decorating an existing Python function with the Coiled Function decorator. The entire workflow ran in &lt;10 minutes and cost ~$0.36.\nIn the next example, we used Xarray to process 6 TB of the cloud-hosted NOAA water model where we computed the average water table depth for each county in the US for the year 2020. We parallelized and distributed the work across 50 VMs using a Coiled cluster. The workflow ran in &lt; 5 minutes and cost ~$1.\n\n\n\nLuis commented on how cloud computing is a barrier for many teams, but tools like Coiled provide options for working in the cloud easily. In fact, Coiled is just half the magic (provisioning cloud resources); the rest is the open source packages, which together help science move faster."

    "section": "",
    "text": "NASA Openscapes Mentors Aaron Friesz, Andy Barrett, Danny Kaufman, Rhys Leahy, Alexis Hunzinger, with Julia Lowndes are co-leading this session at the ESIP Summer 2024 meeting.\nESIP Meeting theme: Grounded in Trust: Data Ethics Empower Collaboration\nDetails on the ESIP site.\nPurpose of our session: Facilitate a space to find common challenges & solutions for “moving to the cloud”, which includes onboarding people to a shared compute space and fledging them to their own space. We will share stories of how people go from 0 to Hub and then fledge to other clouds. Have mechanisms to hear many voices and come up with creative solutions. We will also invite people to contribute (earthaccess, Cookbook) and how we onboard. Share stories of how people go from 0 to Hub and then fledge to other cloud. \nOutcomes from our session: Learn from participants: what are challenges encountered from onboarding & fledging? Co-design solutions. Blog post - summary posted on ESIP/NASA-Openscapes blog. We’ll include authors from Roll Call unless you’d prefer to opt out; we’ll share a draft beforehand. \nProcess: Stories from NASA Openscapes (30 min); Breakout groups (25 min); Discussion (25 min)\n\n\nNASA Openscapes is a community where staff with similar roles supporting users across 12 NASA Earth Science Data Centers (DAACs) – through building trust – have been able to learn, develop common tutorials, and teach together to support users migrating workflows using NASA Earthdata to the Cloud. NASA Openscapes Mentors co-create and maintain an open Earthdata Cloud Cookbook of common reusable open source tutorials that they have co-developed for specific audiences and tested and refined through frequent workshops, hackathons, and Openscapes Champions Cohorts. We also created the earthaccess Python library which made users’ first experience with NASA Earthdata Cloud be two lines of Python code rather than 30 lines of bash code (that also required clicking and managing hidden files for authentication). The work we do together as a small community has enormous cascading effects, particularly as they visibly practice open science daily via contributions to open source code and documentation. We have supported hundreds of users to have their first hands-on experience with NASA Earthdata in the Cloud in a 2i2c JupyterHub configured for Jupyter, RStudio, MATLAB, and QGIS using our tutorials and docker base images (set up for libraries/environments, Quarto, etc). As the purpose of our JupyterHub is initial learning and exploration, we are now focused on “fledging” – answering the question “where do researchers go when they leave the Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub?” We will share first stories of researchers shifting to their own cloud spaces, attaching their university credit cards in order to do science at scale in the cloud. We will share stories and challenges, and how approaches fit and can be leveraged by the ESIP community."
