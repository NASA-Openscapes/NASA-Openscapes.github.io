    "text": "Overview\nOpenscapes is an approach for doing better science in less time1. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science2, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\nOpenscapes Champions is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata, cloud), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.\nNASA Openscapes is a 3-year project to support scientists using data from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud. As part of this work, we will offer the Openscapes Champions program several times from 2022-2024."

    "text": "Why NASA Earthdata? Why Openscapes?\nWe are getting these questions a lot, so here is our take.\nNASA Earth Science Data Systems missions collect Earth data, including sea ice, physical oceanography, vegetation and many other parameters – data used by researchers around the world for many different purposes, including answering pressing questions in ecology and environmental science. Further, NASA promotes open science – from the NASA Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program 2020 Highlights report:\n\nOpen data are the foundation of ESDS efforts to fulfill the program’s vision of accelerating scientific advancement for societal benefit through innovative Earth science data stewardship and technology development….to leverage the diversity of global Earth science communities to advance open science.\n\nOpenscapes’ long-term goal is to enable robust, inclusive, and enduring science- and data-driven solutions to global and time-sensitive challenges. We approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. We see data analysis and stewardship as entryways to meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skill sets and mindsets while empowering them as leaders. With NASA support, the project team and the partners, the Openscapes Framework fundamentally changes the paradigm for supporting research teams and DAAC mentors, first to work more openly with their teams on the cloud, and ultimately to advance open science!\nOpenscapes is co-directed by project leads Lowndes and Robinson, and operated at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), University of California Santa Barbara."

    "text": "We’re onboarding Mentors for Year 2!\nBackground: Join a cross-DAAC mentor community creating & teaching resources to help researchers migrate workflows to the cloud. We meet and learn together, working with alignment on common needs for researchers using NASA Earthdata. Mentors receive Carpentries Instructor training and Openscapes mentorship to help you refine teaching strategies for Cloud, while collaborating on cloud tutorials to reuse rather than reinventing separately. You will teach and support in opportunities of different types: Hackathons, Workshops, and the Openscapes Champions program. We expect a range of technical ability and teaching experience. Through these growth opportunities within a broader community engagement approach, you will also gain visibility for your work as well as for your DAACs. The expected time commitment is 3-4 days/month per year. This accounts for a minimum of 4 hours/month of synchronous calls with the rest of the time being self-directed towards improving support approaches for your specific DAAC.\n\n\nOur immediate activities with the Mentors are:\n\nStrengthen the DAAC Mentor community of practice as they develop and teach a common set of tutorials and coordinate and lead learning events, in part through our twice monthly Openscapes Cohort Calls\nLead the 2022 NASA Openscapes Champions cohort with research teams (March-April), with Mentors assisting to support researchers and learn a new modality of support\n\nOur schedule:\n\nMentor kick-off 1:1's! We'd like to meet with each DAAC mentor team to get to know you and discuss the specific needs of your DAAC and the research teams you support. Please coordinate with the others from your DAAC and book a 30-minute intro meeting the week of June 17 (or June 24 as a back-up). \nJune 30 Mentor Cohort Call We will have our first call with the full group of mentors on June 30 - to introduce everyone and orient around the NASA Openscapes project.\nSummer Break - From the beginning of July through mid-August we are going to take a break from our biweekly calls to let this group rest. We hope that during this break each DAAC will do a bit of light planning for what they hope to accomplish in the next year to share at our first call when we return at the end of August.  \nBack to our DAAC Mentor schedule: We will pick back up on regular meetings on August 25 (or that week) with our biweekly meetings. Our initial call will include sharing plans, UWGs and other events on the calendar and continuing the orientation for new DAAC mentors. Returning DAAC mentors will walk through the initial cloud tutorials as a way to onboard the group to data access in the cloud and to get your fresh perspective on our existing material. (What works? What's confusing?) \n\n\n\nThis is a Cohort for research teams using NASA Earthdata and transitioning workflows to the Cloud.\nhttps://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2022-nasa-champions/\n\n\n\n\nOur immediate activities with the Mentors are:\n\nBuild a DAAC community of practice through our twice monthly Openscapes Cohort Calls, a Carpentries Intro Python/Git Workshop, and Carpentries Instructor Training\nDevelop participating teams as Mentors and help them practice teaching in a style to prepare them for a workshop at the American Geophysical Union Conference (AGU) (Dec) and the Openscapes Champions cohort with research teams (early 2022)\nSupport Mentors towards establishing a common set of tutorials that they can then build off their DAAC-specific and science examples\n\n\n\n\nThe Cloud Hackathon: Transitioning Earthdata Workflows to the Cloud is a virtual 5-day (4 hours per day) collaborative open science learning experience aimed at exploring, creating, and promoting effective cloud-based science and applications workflows using NASA Earthdata Cloud data, tools, and services (among others), in support of Earth science data processing and analysis in the era of big data. All details and tutorials are available at: https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/.\n\n\n\nWe will have Cohort Calls with the DAAC Mentors throughout 2021.
