    "text": "Lisa Kempler works at MathWorks as a Research and Geoscience Strategist. She supports research and educator communities seeking to integrate their platforms with software tools and resources that enable effective data access, computing, and results sharing and publishing. She regularly meets with research communities, including site developers and users of data and compute services, developing programs and working with teams to provide implementation and user support. Lisa attended Brown University, Boston University, and Northeastern University.\nQuick links:\nMore and more data is being made available for users on NASA’s Earthdata Cloud platform. NASA Openscapes collaborates with a community of user-support staff across ten of the NASA Earth science Distributed Active Archives (DAACs), with the aim to help researchers transition their computational workflows to the Cloud using NASA Earthdata.\nThrough the NASA Openscapes Champions, an annual program that supports cohorts of science teams, a number of researchers expressed interest in using the data hosted on NASA Earthdata with MATLAB. The initial NASA Openscapes’ JupyterHub platform hosted by 2i2c, and tutorials, were Python-based. However, to make this transition, users need to be able to use software tools that are familiar to them that enable access to the data and can process it. The NASA Openscapes team reached out to MathWorks, developers of MATLAB, to support the effort to integrate MATLAB into NASA Openscapes JupyterHub and tutorials. The goal was to enable direct Cloud data access from MATLAB.\nTogether, our two teams have successfully installed MATLAB on NASA Openscapes JupyterHub, visible in the screenshot below. It is now available for researchers participating in NASA Openscapes affiliated learning events to try out with Earthdata data. Researchers will “bring their own license” (BYOL) and will be prompted to input that information to access MATLAB.\nThe MATLAB implementation on Openscapes JupyterHub consists of\nIn addition, we’ve written a detailed tutorial to help users learn the system and process the data. The MATLAB tutorial from NASA Openscapes includes code examples, that cover:\nIt’s new to work with NASA Earthdata on the NASA Openscapes JupyterHub, and even newer with MATLAB! We are excited that teams participating in the 2022 and 2023 NASA Openscapes Champions program are already logging into Openscapes and using MATLAB on the platform and continuing to push forward NASA Earthdata Cloud access through MATLAB. We will share more results on this work at the upcoming American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting on Tuesday, December 12. If you are interested in this work, please get in touch (lisak@mathworks.com).\nTo learn more about using MATLAB with data on NASA Openscapes, watch the video presentation to the NASA Openscapes Mentors or read the MATLAB Tutorial.\nAcknowledgements: A special thanks to Erin Robinson of NASA Openscapes and Luis Lopez Espinosa of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) for their collaboration on the NASA Openscapes MATLAB implementation and their contributions to this blog post."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is a brief summary of the session we led at the 2024 ESIP summer conference, focused primarily on the breakout group feedback from the session! We define Onboarding as a friendly first experience in the Cloud, framed via technical infrastructure, lessons on open science and cloud concepts, and social support. We define Fledging as a friendly set up for Cloud that works for me, including a plan, how to do it, how to pay for it. It means leaving the nest, soaring high and perhaps building your own nest.\nQuicklinks:\nThe theme of the 2024 ESIP Summer meeting was “grounded in trust”, with a focus on ethics and establishing relationships. This theme rooted us: we’ve spent the last 3 years introducing people to the cloud for scientific computing, motivated by the fact that NASA is moving Earthdata to the cloud. We focused on helping scientists using NASA Earthdata and what this migration means for them. But only in the past year have we focused on “offboarding”, to complement our onboarding process (focused on where they go after they leave our JupyterHub) – but that term felt harsh, like walking the plank. We wanted a friendlier way to talk about this, so we call it “fledging” since people are spreading their wings after being in the “nest” with their nestmates, learning together in the JupyterHub we provide for workshop participants, in collaboration with our partners at 2i2c.\nFirst, Alexis Hunzinger (GES DISC) shared Aronne Merrelli’s story (show-not-tell). Aronne was a participant in the 2023 NASA Openscapes Champions group, and found the Cloud to be a “superpower” - see this blog post summary and video of Aronne sharing with the 2024 Champions science teams.\nThen, Aaron Friesz (LP DAAC) and Danny Kaufman (ASDC) broke down all the components that helped build that nest. This includes a central focus on researcher/user needs and iterating through teaching; How we work – openly, with synchronous and asynchronous space and place; and all the onboarding support for how they learn and work.\nAnd then Julie Lowndes (Openscapes) and Eli Holmes (NOAA Fisheries) shared about fledging experiences so far - what we do and think about. This focused on where people fledge to and cost. Eli Holmes shared how she fledged in a different way, not only as a researcher but also as a facilitator who sets up infrastructure for others within her government agency. She shared how not all the participants leaving the nest are birds. Some are zebras and others are fish. Their needs when fledging are fundamentally different from those of the birds. And even among the birds, there is variety."

    "text": "Breakout groups - participant feedback\nParticipants in the room self-identified as Cloud enablers/facilitators (60%), as well as Cloud users (35%) and neither (27%).\n\nWe asked participants to share their experiences in breakout groups. We wanted to know from our audience of cloud facilitators/enablers and cloud users, what solutions and challenges they have found when it comes to onboarding to and fledging from the Cloud. Between the feedback received during this breakout session and responses from a survey sent to past program participants about their current cloud usage and challenges, here are some common challenges and new points we haven’t heard before.\nStand out:\n\nCreate easy wins early on to make onboarding more encouraging!\nInterest in learning how to set up environments via tutorials.\nHow does one find or qualify for these “onboarding” opportunities? It seems like there is a privilege based on who you know.\n\nCommon ones:\n\nFor onboarding, keep tutorials simple, but relevant to the discipline.\nPeople feel successful and supported through many, open channels of connection (e.g. Slack, hack/coworking times, anonymous questions, etc.).\nSome feedback from users: when I go to nasa.gov, I can’t find any cross-DAAC stuff, or earthaccess.\nNot all data is in the cloud, we are still operating in hybrid mode.\nIt’s a challenge to spend time and energy optimizing legacy code and data formats for the cloud - it’s tempting to just “lift and shift”.\nOrganizational silos and management priorities are a barrier to experimenting with cloud capabilities.\n\nThe following screenshots illustrate participants responses to several questions. We include them here for readers to consider where their own communities land.\n\n\n\n\nOne thing we noted was that more people had thoughts about onboarding rather than fledging. And that’s ok! Fledging is very new to us as an idea, having really started talking about it last summer at ESIP and more readily (and calling it fledging) at AGU and this spring, in conversations with Yuvi Panda, Carl Boettiger, and Eli Holmes."

    "section": "Closing thoughts",
    "text": "Closing thoughts\nJulie Lowndes - ESIP is a great conference - for me it feels like RStudio and rOpenSci conferences, which means it is welcoming and highly productive and filled with friends everywhere - even when you don’t know them yet. This is my 4th year of ESIP confs (starting in 2020 when Erin Robinson invited me to keynote and this kicked off our NASA Openscapes collaboration!), and my second in person. Last year, I took away how Aaron Friesz remarked that “I’ve been to many ESIP conferences representing my data center (LP DAAC), but this year I felt like people saw me as someone to collaborate with as an expert on supporting users in the cloud”. This year, I’m taking away how embraced and loved “earthaccess” is. “Earthaccess” is a python library that has vastly improved everyone’s experience accessing NASA Earthdata programmatically (both locally and in the cloud). It was first developed by Luis López through working closely with Champions science teams and is now awesomely co-developed by a NASA open source community with contributors extending across DAACs, other parts of NASA, and beyond. I heard “earthaccess” everywhere, in talks, in hallways. People used “earthaccess” used like “Zoom” or “ggplot” - it’s a tool you use, no need to discuss further, we all know it as a vital part of the picture. I also really felt how the word “Openscapes” was used by many as an “us” or “we”; “Openscapes does this” means a community with many many people involved – and people see and feel that. This was always the vision that Erin Robinson and I have had, and I really felt it here. It was amazing.\nCarl Boettiger, during a coworking debrief: Onboarding is a very visible thing, we can ensure there’s no sharp edges in the nest. But when you leave there are more edges - we can think of how to soften, where it works well, where there is a need. We can learn where there are training places and where it’s technical, what to develop to put in place."

The goals of this session were to hear from and boost a broad set of leaders from across the US government and academia to highlight open science in daily work, including peer-teaching, mentoring, and learning. Building from our session at ESIP Winter 2022, we hope to create more channels for inter- and cross-agency learning, and share open science stories across agencies, as part of the 2023 Year of Open Science as recently declared by the US Biden-Harris Administration. Speakers shared stories about open science in government and their experiences with Openscapes. Stories were shared in a “Fishbowl” format, where speakers each shared and then there was a broader discussion with the 50+ participants. This blog is co-authored with the speakers.\nQuick links:"

    "text": "3 approaches for the year of open science\nThis session brought together a broad set of leaders from across the U.S. government and academia to highlight open science in daily work, including peer-teaching, mentoring, and learning. They shared stories, examples, and concrete tips for supporting each other and our colleagues with collaborative, open science approaches, with the aim of strengthening channels for inter- and cross-agency action in the Year of Open Science 2023. This session builds from our session at ESIP Winter 2022, and you can review the summary blog and videos: 3 takeaways for planning for the year of open science. Those 3 takeaways were 1. Both top-down and grassroots efforts are necessary; 2. Dissolve silos by supporting early adopters; 3. Reuse and build from existing efforts to accelerate change.\nThis year, presenters shared Openscapes stories and approaches following another year’s work mentoring, coaching, and teaching colleagues as well as listening, advocating, and informing open science policy at different levels. Their stories come from the many phases of open science movement building they represent: a first welcome, inside government organizations, “forking” Openscapes internally, and contributing back to open science. What emerged was real lightbulb moments and real-time interplay between panelists who have not previously worked together as we recognized common themes and learned from each other.\nHere are 3 overlapping takeaways from this session that all speakers embodied:\n\nExamine the cracks; invest in real relationships\nBreak the hero mentality in science; invest in radical collaboration\nBuild morale through learning; advocate for learning time\n\nWe describe these more fully below. And as we advocate for open science in this Year of Open Science, let’s connect open science with building morale and empowering individuals as well as with the higher quality of work created."

    "section": "Examine the cracks; invest in real relationships",
    "text": "Examine the cracks; invest in real relationships\n“Examining the cracks’’ was a concept brought up by Ileana Fenwick at the very beginning of our session, and it resonated with the other panelists throughout. Ileana designed and leads the Pathways to Open Science program, a remote event series of community calls and coworking for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. The first session, held on the evening of this ESIP panel, welcomed over 80 participants! Ileana shared that as she became empowered with open science, she thought exposure alone would be enough to attract other people to open science events. It wasn’t; there are many reasons why folks do not feel included in science and open science. It caused her to examine the cracks - why wouldn’t she participate in this program if she saw it in her inbox? This influenced the design of the Pathways program, with a deep investment in engagement. Ileana partnered Openscapes with Black in Marine Science (BIMS) and Black in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS), and met 1:1 with faculty at HBCUs, to learn about their students’ needs and introduce her ideas for the program. Ileana shared these three pieces of advice, saying:\n\nSurface level efforts are easy to spot. Some questions to ask as you plan your program goals and efforts are: What is your motivation for this work? Is it genuine? Is the space you’re inviting students to a safe space for marginalized students? (Do they know that?) It is clear when the broader impacts are written last. Fairness is not an afterthought, your planning and process should demonstrate that.\nWe exist. If your efforts are not yielding broad participation, it’s not because we aren’t out there. It’s because your efforts need to be tailored more specifically and intentionally.\nCenter broad voices. If there are no members of your team from your target audience or your team is not reflective, this is a moment to step back and ask yourself if YOU need to be the one doing this work. Amplify and empower broad leadership, support them, compensate them, use privilege to push the project forward.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSlide from Ileana Fenwick’s talk on challenging her views on how to engage. Examining the cracks led Ileana to see that that exposure to information is not enough, and this influenced the design of the Pathways to Open Science program\n\n\nLater, Corey Clatterbuck described the momentum at the California Water Boards following an Openscapes Cohort she and Anna Holder co-led in 2022. They knew they wanted to “fork” the Openscapes curriculum to adapt it to the needs of their colleagues, so they examined the cracks using results of an internal 2019 Data Literacy Survey with Water Boards employees. Corey and Anna were surprised by the results and, like Ileana, designed their programming to meet these needs. The results showed that respondents were motivated by interest in particular data tasks (image below, top half) and not in specific software or coding languages (image below, bottom half). In short, people were more interested in learning how to do things in their job (goal-oriented), than learning specific software (tool-oriented). From this, the design of their Cohort emphasized the human over technical approach to open science to reach the majority of Water Boards colleagues who might be interested in open science. They increased the length of each call from 1.5 hours to 2 hours, and added a new module on documentation to replace the one on coding-strategies.\n\n\n \n\n\nResults from the California Water Boards internal 2019 Data Literacy Survey showed that respondents were motivated by interest in particular data tasks (top half) and not in specific software or coding languages (bottom half). Examining these cracks influenced how Clatterbuck and Holder forked and designed the Champions Program at the California Water Boards. (slide from Clatterbuck)\n\n\nIleana’s approach of “Examining the cracks” also caught Cassie Nickles’ ear. She is a Mentor with NASA Openscapes, a community that supports researchers as they migrate analytical workflows to the Cloud. Cassie and her colleagues across other NASA Earthdata data centers are co-creating common tutorials, a review & reuse process, and as well as community of practice for teaching, mentoring, and facilitation for NASA Earthdata Cloud. As she was onboarding into her current role, Cassie became overwhelmed by the steps and processes required by end users to access and use NASA Earthdata. She figured if she was confused, others might be too and wanted to help simplify navigating the complicated systems.\n\n\n“The data analysis needed for the pressing problems we face should not be limited by the complexity of the underlying systems or a lack of computer engineering skills.” —Luis Lopez, NSIDC\n\n\nCassie and Openscapes Mentor-colleague Catalina Oaida Taglialatela made Cheatsheets with clickable icons that lead to tutorials for NASA Earthdata Cloud researchers! Having filled some gaps, Cassie is now recognizing more cracks moving forward: how do we get these resources in front of the folks they’re intended for?"

    "section": "Break the hero mentality in science; invest in radical collaboration",
    "text": "Break the hero mentality in science; invest in radical collaboration\nErin Robinson opened the session saying that solutions to large-scale environmental and social challenges require radical collaboration, but have been limited by the hero model, where science is competitive, siloed, and rewards an individual hero, often a white man. She said we together are changing this story. We do this by welcoming people where they are and through creative approaches that blend methods from open source software development, mentoring, coaching, and art.\nReflecting as a Mentor at NOAA Fisheries supporting 6 Openscapes cohorts (240 staff) in 2022, Josh London said that “collaboration is something we’re never taught.” Individuality is instilled in grad school and we never have a chance to change this through “business as usual.” We need the space and place to relearn. Don’t spend your time trying to solve things yourself. Learn together first! It’s ok to ask for help early. Adyan Rios is also a NOAA Fisheries Mentor, who is helping develop a learning culture at the Southeast Fisheries Science Center through leading “Surf Sessions” where colleagues cowork remotely and share what they know. Adyan echoed this need for radical collaboration, saying that it’s radical because it means being vulnerable. It means people sharing things they haven’t figured out yet, while they’re still messy. Or share a cool thing you learned, like a keyboard shortcut. If you just learned it, chances are someone in your community didn’t know it yet either. Sharing makes their day a little better and make their work more efficient. This harkens back to Cassie creating cheatsheets to share what she figured out to help others.\n\n\n“Team collaboration is not something that we’ve all learned from the beginning. In grad school it’s instilled in us this idea that anything meaningful that we do in science is supposed to be done by us as individuals.” —Josh London, NOAA AFSC\n\n\n\n\n\n“This mindset and practice [of learning together first] has been revolutionary for us at NOAA.” —Adyan Rios, NOAA SEFSC\n\n\nBreaking the hero model is something that Luis Lopez has been thinking about too. He shared that as a software engineer, something he has learned through the NASA Openscapes Mentors community is to empathize with researchers and not expect that software alone is the hero. The key is to really understand learners and researchers, get to know them and see how they work and where they are stuck. Working with his NASA Mentor colleagues, Luis identified that there were many steps involved before researchers could be hands-on with data in the cloud, and was intent on reducing that “time to science”. Luis has led development of the earthaccess python library to search, download or stream NASA Earth science data, enabling a researcher to get to the science with four lines of Python code, instead of running command line code that saves a hidden .netrc file to the user’s computer and requires reactivation after one hour. Collaborating with other Mentors has been critical here – again breaking the hero model – as Cassie’s Cheatsheets helped visualize all the steps previously involved that were cumbersome for scientists."

    "text": "Build morale through learning; advocate for learning time\n“How to make learning part of your job” and “When do you carve out time to learn” are questions that come up frequently, as they did here. Pointing to examples of how other individuals and agencies do this has been super powerful: it is negotiated with supervisors at NOAA to be included in Individual Work Plans, and the NASA Earthdata Mentors are a fantastic example of the power of high-level support for learning. The NASA Mentors shared how the Mentor community has been able to learn and collaborate together over the past two years. This was because their time was approved at a high level, by NASA policy and by their managers. This approved time has given space for them to first share and listen, find the common, and then build together, reuse, and amplify.\n\n\n“Learning builds morale: it gives people an opportunity to change workflows, learn new skills, improve the culture, and take ownershipof that” —Josh London, NOAA AFSC\n\n\nWe’re seeing some of this trickle out beyond the Openscapes curriculum. Josh London talked about how we often focus on the shiny new tools (python, R, Quarto, GitHub) but it’s the culture shifts that are the real meaningful change. He said it’s so encouraging to see in a calendar invite for a meeting that someone’s already initiated an agenda in a shared document and that there are multiple people contributing notes there at the same time. Additionally, learning to use tools like GitHub for shared “todo” lists and better project management for teams has increased morale for NOAA Fisheries teams. Teams are also using these tools for more communication to onboard other team members to their projects, passing forward this increased morale that comes from learning together.\nLoneliness during the Pandemic was mentioned several times - Adyan, Cassie, Corey, and Ileana all onboarded to their current roles during the pandemic. They noted that shared practices like coworking along with collaborating asynchronously with GitHub and Google Docs helped them feel less alone and build real connections with their colleagues. And, it helped them learn skills they needed to do their jobs. They saw that these skills would help other colleagues as well, so they have dedicated time to teaching and supporting colleagues, and advocating for learning time from supervisors.\n\n\n“Not everyone needs the same learning curve; we can send down a rope and help others get to where they need to be sooner.” —Adyan Rios, NOAA SEFS\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe California Water Boards Openscapes Cohort emphasized psychological safety and culture, uniting data strategies, and documentation to create a welcoming environment, build community, and reduce loneliness in learning new skills.

The vision is what’s possible because of open science: climate solutions and democracy.

Using the cloud-hosted JupyterHub for the workshop allowed participants real time and active participation during the Notebook presentation. This is significant in that it allows global participants successful access to NASA Earthdata resources and demonstrates the processes of discovery, access, and analysis of NASA Cloud-hosted Earthdata data. Participants were allowed access the the workshop hub for an extended period of two weeks to continue their exploration of the Notebook and resources.\nWe presented the following notebooks from the ORNL DAAC’s repository of NASA Airborne Data Science Tutorials:\n\nMapping Invasive Species Using Supervised Machine Learning and AVIRIS-NG\n\n\n\nLessons learned\n\n2i2c was amazing in allowing for an extended period of Workshop Hub access and juggling a few workshop needs over that time period\nThe training video will continue to be public.

    "text": "At the AGU 2025 Fall Meeting I received the AGU Greg Leptoukh Lecture Award. This award celebrates the life of an inspiring Earth scientist in our community and recognizes significant contributions to informatics, computational, or data sciences through research, education, and related activities. Receiving this award is a huge honor. I have worked hard and am proud of what I have done for science, scientists, and people supporting science. And I greatly value my many collaborators who work closely with me; we are receiving this award together. I know this award reflects all our work, as well as me, and it’s really special to be called out.\nThe blog shares a quick overview of my lecture. It focuses on the official citation for my award written by NASA Openscapes Mentors Aaron Friesz (now at ESIP), Amy Steiker, Luis Lopez, plus Allison Horst, and my official response. I will give the lecture again online in early 2026 – we will share details when we know – and we will update this post with a recording.\nQuicklinks:\n\nSlides - ”Forking as a Worldview”: How Openscapes uses the open source concept of copy-modify to support researchers & shift culture in science\nhttps://www.agu.org/honors/leptoukh\nhttps://www.agu.org/honors/leptoukh/past-recipients\n\nCross-posted at openscapes.org/blog, nmfs-openscapes.github.io/blog, nasa-openscapes.github.io/news.\n\nIn December 2025 in New Orleans, as part of the Greg Leptoukh Lecture Award I gave a 75-minute invited lecture: ”Forking as a Worldview: How Openscapes uses the open source concept of copy-modify to support researchers & shift culture in science”. Openscapes Mentors were sitting in the front row, boosting my courage and sharing my joy.\nI co-authored the talk with the Openscapes Core Team: Stefanie Butland, Andy Teucher, Melanie Burgess, Stephanie Amend, Ileana Fenwick, Liz Neeley. We told more stories and practices of our team – the unseen infrastructure that enables us to have outsized impact, and continually expand possibilities with our collaborators.\n\n\n\n\nAaron Friesz, Amy Steiker, Sudhir Shrestha, Julie Lowndes, Danie Kinkade, Alex Lewandowski, Luis Lopez as Julie receives Leptoukh Award, AGU 2025.\n\n\n\nThe talk’s structure (forked from my documenting things talk at Posit Conf 2023):\n\nForking mindset - forking (v) means to copy and modify. We fork code, and also ideas, structures, agendas, documentation, programs…\nWhat’s possible from this + how we work - stories of how forking has made it possible for NOAA scientists to develop collaborative workflows for data-intensive science; how forking has made it possible for NASA data center staff to revolutionize Earthdata workflows in the Cloud; and how forking has made it possible for Openscapes to be sustainable. This was my first time talking more about how I shifted from academic scientist to small business owner and growing the team to support the work we do.\nMeeting the moment together - it’s been a hard, disappointing year. And yet. We can all continue to work together, create our own certainty, default to open. The (Hidden) social infrastructure that drives this is scaled with trust and kindness.\n\n\nOfficial AGU Citation - Greg Leptoukh Lecture Award\nNote: this citation and response will be posted on Julie’s AGU profile in the coming months.\nDr. Julia Stewart Lowndes is transforming environmental and Earth science through her visionary leadership in open, collaborative, and inclusive data science. She has redefined how scientific teams work together—empowering researchers to do better science in less time, together—and inspiring a movement toward more effective, inclusive, and reproducible Research.\nTrained as a marine scientist with a Ph.D. from Stanford University, and later as a scientist at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), Dr. Lowndes gained key insights into the challenges faced by solo scientists when working with big data. Her 2017 paper in Nature Ecology and Evolution, “Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools,” (Lowndes et al. 2017) articulated a compelling vision for modernizing scientific workflows. By addressing both the technical and human challenges of data science, her work has catalyzed cultural change across government agencies, academic institutions, and research networks.\nIn 2018, Dr. Lowndes founded Openscapes, a pioneering program that mentors individuals and research teams in open, reproducible, and collaborative science. Through initiatives such as NASA Openscapes, she has reshaped how NASA data centers and researchers collaborate—accelerating cloud migration, strengthening interdisciplinary connections, and fostering psychological safety within teams. Openscapes’ work with NOAA, NASA, and EPA has advanced the culture of open science across the federal research landscape and was featured in the White House’s 2024 Year of Open Science fact sheet for its exemplary mentorship with NOAA Fisheries.\nDr. Lowndes is also a dedicated advocate for equity and inclusion in data science. She co- founded R-Ladies Santa Barbara and advises the Pathways to Open Science program supporting Black environmental and marine researchers. Her efforts have built welcoming communities that empower those historically excluded from technical fields to lead in open Science.\nDr. Lowndes exemplifies the spirit of the Greg Leptoukh Lecture, which honors innovations in informatics that enable scientific discovery. Like Greg Leptoukh, she recognizes that progress in science depends not only on technical excellence but also on collaboration, transparency, and community. Her leadership has created a more inclusive, efficient, and hopeful model for how science is done—making her a profoundly deserving recipient of this honor.\nAaron Friesz, Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP)\nNASA Openscapes Mentors and Allison Horst\n\n\nJulia’s Response - Greg Leptoukh Lecture Award\nIt is an absolute honor to receive the Greg Leptoukh Lecture award recognizing innovations in computational and data informatics that enable scientific discovery. I feel an intense upwelling of love and gratitude for my colleagues that is difficult to describe. It is a privilege to feel such joy about one’s colleagues. And yet, it is quite a common trait of our greater open science community that reflects the deep value of collaboration through trust, empathy, and kindness.\nI created Openscapes to be a feeling of welcome and empowerment around data-intensive science, having felt this myself as a marine ecologist welcomed and empowered by the R open source programming community. Since 2018 we’ve been directly mentoring nearly one thousand researchers and people supporting research, while co-creating mechanisms together so we can all turn around and support countless others within our work-lives. We continue to learn from, with, and for each other, every effort turning our Flywheel (Robinson and Lowndes 2022). We reuse and “fork” what works in new places, using a concept from software engineering for reuse and credit. Openscapes now means more to people than I can possibly define. Its impacts are impossible to quantify, as so many “n of 1” individuals make a whole wave of change in a different place, and in a way that is specific and empathetic to that place. This is movement building. The connections and innovations across interleaving communities and what it means for science and society is beautiful.\nMy nomination for the Leptoukh Lecture is one example. My dear colleagues Amy Steiker and Luis Lopez of NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center) – representing the NASA Openscapes Mentors co-creating and teaching common tutorials to support researchers as they migrate analytical workflows to the Cloud – collaborated even as Aaron Friesz moved on to a new job at ESIP, where he supports the data community in new ways. And they included Allison Horst, a data scientist, teacher, and longtime collaborator who developed all Openscapes art, but who they had not yet met. They forked their systems for co-development and drew from our open community networks for a new purpose, just as we do when we build other social and technical infrastructure for science.\nWe’ve got more work to do. As Johnson & Wilkinson write in “All We Can Save” continue to drive us: “We” speaks to the collective, to collaboration, to community, to the relational work at hand. Addressing the climate crisis…will take everyone. We cannot, we must not, go it alone.”\nDr. Julia Stewart Lowndes\nOpenscapes\nFounding director\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLowndes, Julia S.

    "text": "Navigating NASA Earthdata together with earthaccess\nNASA Earthdata has a 5-year track record of successful and collaborative Cloud trainings. NASA Openscapes Mentors are supporting Earthdata users and doing so efficiently and with less maintenance burden, while solving previously unseen gaps, together and openly. This was evident in the way we were able to lead Champions by leveraging our existing systems and reusing materials during a time when many NASA staff were furloughed. For our Nov 13-14 events, earthaccess contributors from 4 different NASA Data Centers (NSIDC, ORNL, ASDC, PO.DAAC), as well as Development Seed, University of New Hampshire, and Openscapes collaborated and co-taught using resources co-developed by the NASA Openscapes and earthaccess communities. See the slides for more details on each topic: \n\nWhat is Openscapes & NASA Openscapes?, Julie Lowndes (Openscapes) + Amy Steiker (NSIDC)\nNASA Earthdata & cloud computing, Michele Thornton (ORNL)\nAccelerating access through open, collaborative dev, Amy Steiker (NSIDC)\nUsing earthaccess - quickstart & in action, Mikala Beig (NSIDC)\nStreamlining analyses for real research projects. ex ICESat-2 tracks with Mosaic Cruise (temporal) (notebook) (20 min) - Andy Barrett (NSIDC)\nVision for earthaccess: Broadening the scope & virtual datasets Danny Kaufman (ASDC)\nResources and Contributing - Cookbook and Open Communities, Celia Ou (PO.DAAC)\n\nThe goals of the events were to provide a friendly welcome to NASA Earthdata and earthaccess for new and seasoned adopters*. We wanted participants to feel ready to get hands-on experience in Day 2; feel comfortable using earthaccess; provide the tools to engage in the community and to contribute; and capture needs and feedback. Here are a few things that stood out from these events.\n*Credit to Max Jones (Development Seed) for using the word “adopters” rather than “users” in describing the recent Zarr Summit.\n\n“How do you know” what data you’re looking for and then find it ?\n\n\nI am wondering how you “know” what the most recent version is and is the Data Catalog on the website the easiest way for someone to understand what data are potentially out there? Or do you recommend searching here?\n\n\nFor newcomers to NASA Earthdata, we heard from learners that it is still daunting to know what datasets are out there, what information they provide, how to know what the latest version is, etc. In the group discussion on Day 1 and the breakout rooms on Day 2, Mentors spent a lot of quality time demonstrating navigating the Earthdata Search website to look for datasets for a particular topic. Mentors screenshared how to use keywords to key into a dataset, then using the spatial and temporal querying in Earthdata Search to narrow it down and look at it visually. And then taking what was learned from that exploration back to the code with earthaccess.search_data(). A complementary approach to Earthdata Search was to screenshare Earthdata to Worldview to discover new datasets (and there was discussion of how an Earthdata AI tool would be amazing too).\nAmy Steiker (NSIDC) suggested a new feature idea:I wonder if we can do more to bridge the gap from earthaccess.search_datasets() to earthaccess.search_data(). Maybe more guidance on parsing some of the key information from the UMM-C record? (Keywords, DOI). Maybe more use cases to explore through Luis López’s https://github.com/betolink/midstac.\n\n\nR users are looking for support accessing NASA Earthdata\n\n\n“Is there any”earthaccess” package for R?”\n\n\nSeveral people asked about support in the R programming language. Amy Steiker (NSIDC) shared how we have a How-to guide on how to access Earthdata using R in our Cookbook, and that there is an earthdatalogin R package that was derived from earthaccess, though it is focused more on the login functionality. More info on NASA’s blog: Easier Access to NASA Earth Science Data in the Cloud. Amy also noted that there are some conversations about how much earthaccess could be called from R with the new improvements to R’s reticulate package, since the current R package is mostly for authentication. \nFollowing this question, Chuck Daniels (Development Seed) developed a brief GitHub gist showing how to use reticulate to use the earthaccess library from R, and shared it live with the group. And since then, Andy Teucher (Openscapes) has posted a discussion in the Cookbook about the current status of using R for NASA Earthdata tutorials. More on this as it develops in the following months.\n\n\nAccess to compute is still a question for folks\n\n\n“Accessing/downloading the data to our disk is important but our personal computers are limited and spatial data is huge. How can I work on the cloud and keep our projects with the data there. Is there a complementary initiative for that analysis on the cloud?”\n\n\nWe still do not have a great answer for this question of “where can I work in the cloud?” Andy Barrett (NSIDC) was able to demonstrate a method called streaming so he can open the data in the cloud without downloading. Then, in the Nov 14 Coworking, participants had access to Openscapes 2i2c JupterHub to try this and other demos hands-on. The purpose of the Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub is for learning during workshops (and with continued short-term access to experiment), but is not a place for long-term “real science”. Folks suggested CryoCloud as one option for longer term work."

As the NASA Openscapes Mentors had given many talks, workshops, and posters throughout the week showcasing and teaching their shared work, we summarized their efforts with a quote from Cassie Nickles:\n\n\n“NASA Openscapes is a collaborative environment for data center [DAAC] staff to collectively support open science initiatives for NASA Earthdata users. We’ve developed awesome material to help Earthdata users (cheatsheets, a python package (earthaccess), NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook).\nPerhaps just as important as what we’ve done however, are mindsets we’ve grown into along the way. It’s okay to share imperfect works in progress. Ideas are not too big or too small to share. We are better at dreaming and implementing the future together.” – Cassie Nickles (PO.DAAC)\n\n\nThen we centered our talk on a layer above: how we work to support these amazing user support staff to collaborate across data centers and as early adopters, co-develop teaching resources and infrastructure to support researchers in the Cloud."

We reach for the Flywheel as a tool for planning, implementation and communication, just as we reach for R, Quarto, and JupyterHubs for analysis, documentation, and cloud computing.\nThe Flywheel is a concept developed by Jim Collins, where transformations occur from consistently doing key activities that add up over time. The Openscapes Flywheel at its simplest form has six steps that we repeat daily, monthly, and over years. Starting from the bottom and going clockwise: Leverage common workflows, skills, and tools; Inspire; Welcome; Create space & place; Invest in learning and trust; Work openly.\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes Flywheel\n\n\n\nWe talked through what this looked like for the NASA Openscapes project in Year 1, and then again in Years 2-3 as the Flywheel gained momentum as the Mentor community grew and supported researchers on the Cloud."

Openscapes is, generally, an approach and a movement that helps researchers and those supporting research find each other and feel empowered to conduct data-intensive science. Through a Carpentries membership, all mentors in the NASA Openscapes community participate in Instructor Training. In addition, NASA Openscapes uses the Carpentries modular style teaching approach and many of the pedagogical tools like live coding to teach learners using NASA Earthdata to access and analyze data in the AWS Cloud."

    "text": "Opportunities for a NASA Subcommunity\nFrom the three presentations it was clear that across NASA, these programs find real benefits leveraging The Carpentries to extend data science skills within NASA’s internal and external communities of practice. As new Instructors complete training in support of these programs, there exist opportunities to build a subcommunity through programming and resources available through The Carpentries Community Development Program.\nAttendees discussed this general interest in forming a cross-NASA Carpentries subcommunity. To kick-off the discussion, Elizabeth Joyner led attendees in two rounds of 3-2-1 silent reflection where she asked participants to list three data science and coding skills that researchers and practical data users need at NASA, two questions about Carpentries subcommunities, and one metaphor or simile about what you envision for a thriving subcommunity of Carpentries Instructors. As we closed out of this discussion, clear themes emerged; attendees are interested in increasing efficiency with data, working more openly and collaboratively with data, building and maintaining reproducible workflows and increasing data fluency and dexterity with NASA data (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1 - Word cloud of 50 most common words across both 3-2-1 exercises.\n\n\n\nFrom the second part of the reflection, the questions generated by the group acted as a starting point for a lively discussion, which will hopefully continue to be good fodder for the subcommunity to develop its initial charge. There were questions about how to find additional Instructors across NASA and who might be missing from this discussion. There were also questions about how to engage NASA grantees and other stakeholders who use NASA data, as well as about how to extend the curriculum being taught and explicit pointers to Library Carpentries.\nThe third prompt was for a metaphor or simile of a thriving community. Some of our favourite imagery was that a thriving community is like a networked dream catcher, a bee hive, or three goats on each other’s shoulders in a trenchcoat trying to sneak in.\nFollowing the teaching model advocated by The Carpentries, the three NASA programs have all intentionally cultivated communities that support learners and support ongoing learning. Considering this, there is general excitement about the possibility of a NASA subcommunity with 20 attendees indicating interest in joining a follow-up conversation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "February through May 2023, Openscapes Mentors from across governments and academia came together for some hands-on learning and practice that had a profound effect on the way we will teach and lead going forward. We learned coaching skills that can help us as professionals – skills like listening rather than solutioneering, asking open-ended questions that empower people to find their own agency and meet their needs. This is a program designed and facilitated by Tara Robertson, a Certified Professional Co-Active and International Coaching Federation Associate Certified Coach. Openscapes has been developing a professional collaborative relationship with Tara since 2021. It was also impactful because it brought together Openscapes Mentors from across government groups (NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, EPA, California Waterboard) so they can learn together and support each other in the 2023 Year of Open Science.\nThis program had a profound impact on the three of us too, as participants as well as program designers and facilitators. We are still trying to define what it was about the program, the process, and everyone involved that led to such a profound sense of trust among us so that we were able to be vulnerable and do courageous things. While these Openscapes Mentors have been collaborating as colleagues together within their organizations (e.g. as NASA Earthdata Mentors or Pathways to Open Science Mentors), this was the first time most of these folks met as a cross-Openscapes mentor community (besides brief encounters at virtual ESIP conference sessions in 2023 and 2022).\nThis truly was a cohort of early adopter “bright spots” - folks who wanted to be better mentors and grow as leaders, even if we didn’t know what that meant yet. Not only were folks working across organizations with other mentors they didn’t know, they were expert scientists being asked to step way outside their comfort zone and be novices. In this setting, they were enthusiastic and fearless learners. There was a really high rate of participation and very few people dropped off over the six sessions. We saw individual growth and impacts feeding back and forth: something introduced gently here that we can practice together makes us comfortable, and now we can take this to other spaces and introduce it gently to others too."

    "text": "Designing a courageous space\nWe connected these bright spots by creating space and place. We met every 2 weeks for 6 remote sessions for a total of 12 hours. Twenty-eight people participated as part of their paid jobs, supported by their organizations rather than doing it “off the side of their desk”. We used a practice already familiar to all Openscapes Mentors: collaborative note-taking Agendas all in one Google doc where we had a shared responsibility to take notes, clarify explanations, add links to resources, and add shared joy and encouragement via emojis, +1’s and comments. We co-designed and helped each other when facilitating, which was instrumental when Tara got sick and lost her voice and Julie stepped in to facilitate the session based on Tara’s prep ahead of time.\nThe 6 sessions focused on specific topics: powerful questions, 3 levels of listening, identifying values, leader within, saboteurs and then taking these coaching skills into mentoring, supervising and sponsoring. For each of the topics, Tara briefly described the topic or skill, did a live demo with one of the participants, and the group described what they observed. Then, Tara gave us a topic to coach on, or some guardrails, and participants went into breakout rooms in pairs to practice coaching and being coached.\nThere was a lot of hands-on doing. Most of the participants said this was the best part of the course and also the most uncomfortable bit. In these pairs, the coaches were learning how to ask questions that help people open up…and this also challenged the coachees, who really dived into their needs and blockers for how to better support open science. It was also a testament to Tara’s own willingness to be vulnerable, demonstrating as a coachee and giving us her own real-life examples.\nThoughts from Tara: Something really special happened with this cohort. There were three main ingredients to this magic:\n\nThe participants were enthusiastic and fearless learners who were willing to step outside their comfort zones and learn new things together. This group of expert scientists from different organizations were willing to be beginner learners with each other. This group embodied courage.\nWe were intentional in the design to maximize psychological safety. At the start of Week 1 we designed an alliance together on how we wanted to be and learn together. I ordered the topics to start with the lower stakes topics and we were intentional about mixing people up across organizations. In the week 5 coaching demo one of the coaching demos the coachee chose to be quite vulnerable and bring a real challenge. This was a turning point where we saw that we can use these skills to surface challenging topics and have honest conversations about barriers in science.\nOpenscapes investment in coaching skills was a unique way to collectively learn some new skills AND build connections between open science leaders across different organizations and Openscapes initiatives: Mentors at NOAA Fisheries, NASA and from the growing Mentor community from CalEPA and Pathways to Open Science."

    "text": "Building skills for listening not solutioneering\nSo called “soft skills” are anything but. This was hard. Learning to ask open ended questions was hard, and what was harder still was listening to be able to ask the next powerful question. How we listen differs whether we are in mentor-mode or coach-mode:\n\nWhen we listen as mentors, we’re trying to understand where our expertise can help someone solve a problem.\nWhen we’re listening as coaches, we’re trying to help the other person define their problem, and tap into their own wisdom to find their solution, likely outside of our domain expertise.\n\nWhat do we mean by a “powerful question”? It’s a short question that can open up a really powerful conversation. It’s open-ended, usually starts with the word “What”, ideally is 5 words or less, and can’t be answered by yes or no. What feels like success to you? What’s in the way? What, if anything, is going unsaid? Which of your core values is being messed with?\nDistinguishing when we’re listening as mentors and when we’re listening as coaches is important, because it determines how we will respond as early adopters who may not know the answer to the question – think cloud computing, how to store increasingly large data, how to give hard feedback to a superior, and how to ask for help in a culture built on competition and the myth of the lone genius. Developing these coach listening skills, including what questions to ask, has helped us help others better (and notice and avoid solutioneering!). It’s also helped us feel less overwhelmed as we learn that it’s okay to not always have the answer!\n\n\n“We need these coaching skills to do powerful work and inspire meaningful connections; this program is a safe space to learn, to challenge our preconceptions, to practice, and to grow. I found it to be so invaluable because it’s a chance to acknowledge and learn about skills that are often unspoken in their ability to improve mentorship and collaboration.” — Ileana Fenwick\n\n\nThoughts from Stef. During the first two sessions, in the breakout rooms to practice coaching in pairs, I defaulted to talking more about the process and how we felt about it because actually practicing coaching, even with specific prompts, felt really really hard. But somehow over time, it got easier. Now I find myself trying out “powerful questions” with my peers in one-to-one conversations or coworking, rather than my usual behavior of suggesting solutions to people’s challenges. And people seem to respond!\nBut what really made this work?\n\nPeople were primed for this based on their prior experiences as Openscapes Mentors. They came expecting a familiar set of norms and psychological safety that allowed them first to get comfortable and then to take risks. With this foundation, together we were able to build trust early on. This is key to developing healthy teams and communities. We all knew it would be worth it even if we didn’t know what we were getting into.\nOften, to offer a program like this, an organization might contract an external professional to deliver it. We took it a step further. Openscapes contracted Tara, with whom we’ve collaborated before, and who is highly respected for her tell-it-like-it-is approach to coaching. The core team of Tara, Julie, and Stef, worked to onboard ourselves and each other to this process using an open facilitation approach rather than working behind a curtain. We met frequently and defined our roles together, agreeing to role-model transparency and vulnerability and to name these things. Julie and Stef took turns managing breakout rooms each week so we could also take turns practicing coaching.\nThe mentors were not our students; they’re our peers and collaborators. Once people opted in, there was no judgment or “sorries” if someone was late or had to miss a session because of life’s responsibilities.\nPractice! We moved away from analyzing and into the doing. It was uncomfortable and people still came and showed up as leaders"

    "text": "Building mindsets as leaders\nDeveloping coaching skills also helped us build new mindsets. There was a braveness that grew throughout our time together that showed up in different ways. One person shared that they are more brave with whom/when/where they might interact as a coach and mentor. They had recently found themselves in-person with someone senior and rather than making nervous small talk found themselves asking powerful questions and really connecting with the senior person more, and felt that they both learned something in this short moment together.\nWe grew these new mindsets with our peers and built trust and community in a really profound way. The topics people surfaced and shared were so vulnerable – navigating racism, personal and structural saboteurs, and the integrations of personal and work life. We had never experienced such vulnerability in our work, and knew we could not shy away from difficult topics but needed to dig further and out based on the courage and trust in the room.\nThoughts from Julie. I’ve talked a lot about the impact of open data science on my career and my life. My science thinking was transformed when I realized I could do an analysis just as easily 100 times with a for-loop as doing it twice, and that I could publish my work via RMarkdown and GitHub to the open web and share via a single URL instead of sending followup emails with different versions of the same PDF or Word doc. Now, I am realizing that the impact of coaching on my thinking might be at this same level. I am still processing it all, but I am feeling more confident in places I have been struggling to show up as my full self. It is somehow helping me bring confidence into a room with me, knowing that I have new skills and a strengthened sense of shared braveness together with this cohort. When we first planned this cohort with Tara, this was new terrain. We asked ourselves, “If this is wildly successful what are the outcomes? What’s possible?“ Here are some ideas we laid out, and I think the Mentors are meeting each one:\n\nPeople model fair behavior in work, life, Openscapes, and our home organizations, to influence culture change\nPeople are braver, share stories and energy at work and other places\nSomeone speaks up in a meeting\nEveryone learns something new! (me too!)\nWe listen better/differently\nWe scale participation - use coaching strategies to empower others sooner, so that existing mentors don’t burn out\nMore people feel safe in Openscapes and open science, and in turn, inspire others to be braver"

This is a concept developed by Jim Collins that we adapted for Openscapes with Erin Robinson (Erin first brought coaching into Openscapes strategy and practices too!). Transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time. Using this model, we welcomed folks to opt in, created space and place so we could invest in learning and trust, and then worked openly together as we practiced as coaches and coachees, leveraging common experiences and skills. This turn of the flywheel is part of building the momentum of kinder and open science, building from past, parallel, and collaborative work from many places. Mentors are already inspiring others with their leadership, pushing the next turn of the flywheel.\nBravery has come up throughout this cohort and this post, and this braveness and fearlessness is in service of something. We’re wanting to connect our daily work with the global moment at hand, so we can better address issues stemming from climate change. As one participant said, “I don’t want to be scared to ask questions anymore”. We want to ask questions with no ego, in rooms with our science peers. We want to break the silences, opening up the rooms so that the next person who has a question but was not sure they would voice it is empowered to speak up.\nIn our final session we paired up to coach each other through developing our own statement of purpose in open science.\n\n\n“I am an elevator to a better tomorrow”\n\n\n\n\n\n“I am a pollinator who connects people to each other and ideas so everyone flourishes”\n\n\n\n\n\n“I am the momentum that answers to my peers”\n\n\n\nWe are all the momentum that answers to our peers. To make meaningful change, we must work across all levels and elevate those who will be the change along with us.\n\n ::: {.caption-text .center-text} Photo by Elliot Lowndes :::"

Forking means taking something that works and is made available, and adapting it to your own use, while being networked back to the source – this networking serves dual purposes of being able to contribute back and also to provide appropriate credit. Forking “something” has traditionally been code, but it can be applied to nearly anything. It is about taking something that works to new places to solve problems faster. Since 2018, Openscapes has been working with teams in government and academia to help upskill science teams to work on big collaborative challenges through open science. With NASA Openscapes, this big challenge is upskilling people that use NASA Earthdata to migrate their workflows to cloud computing, as NASA Earthdata holdings migrate to the cloud. We’ve supported this effort through developing a mentor community across NASA Earth science data centers (DAACs) to co-create common tutorials and develop skills for teaching, mentoring, facilitation. And, in the process, we’ve forked a lot of code, documentation, workshop setup, slides, art, teaching approaches, and even whole programs like NOAA Fisheries Openscapes and Pathways to Open Science. We’ve come to realize that forking is a way of thinking, a worldview. Forking is an important thing to call out as we think about how we innovate together through open science, and I’m excited to talk about it with you all!\nFollowing the talk, she remarked,\n\n\n“I just gave a plenary at an internal NASA meeting (240 people): Forking as a Worldview: A big idea that frames Openscapes thinking. I talked about forking as reusing what works in new places, with examples of earthaccess forking the open source software dev approach into government, and NASA Openscapes and then NOAA Fisheries Openscapes forking open source frameworks to tackle big challenges (cloud migration, data modernization). I shared what people can do to develop forking as a worldview through centering fairness, and real challenges as individuals and orgs make these shifts. And, why it’s worth it: so we can tackle big challenges together and increase morale for teams doing this hard work. So much here from what the whole Openscapes community is doing, I wish we could call out every single example you do to celebrate! Kudos also to Liz Neeley (Liminal) and Maryam Zaringhalam (The White House, NIH National Libraries of Medicine), who reacted to the “forking” concept so much it inspired me to center a whole talk around it, and Erin Robinson – turns out, forking is the first step of the Openscapes Flywheel:)“"

Ileana spoke about how she first heard about open science in 2021, and how she found it so transformative for her science that she developed and leads the Openscapes Pathways to Open Science program for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science.

We had aviator sunglasses (courtesy of Julie’s husband Elliot Lowndes) at the ready in case we met President Biden (we did not).\nOpenscapes was recognized for “movement building for kinder open science for future us: a cross-agency effort at NOAA Fisheries, NASA, and EPA”. Being recognized for “movement building” is significant; it is not an easily-measurable impact. Openscapes’ focus on movement building is having real impact shifting culture across academia, government, and non-profit groups. We help people find each other and collaboratively evolve their work with modern and kind workflows, and there are now over 1000 people who are/have been involved with Openscapes, including those who have brought this with them to new positions and jobs. We all approach open science as a daily practice, a way to work differently, in a kinder way and connect big challenges with daily work. This can show up in different ways depending on our situations, and the work that is long-term, ongoing, and intentional. Scroll recent blog posts to get a sense of this work.\nThe White House recognition follows from an Openscapes submission to The White House Office of Science & Technology Policy Open Science Recognition Challenge in Fall 2023, which was looking to recognize open science stories to benefit society. Co-authors (5 max) were: Julia Lowndes (Openscapes founding director who co-leads & supports initiatives); Erin Robinson (Metadata Game Changers co-founder who co-leads NASA Openscapes & helped scale Openscapes with the Flywheel); Eli Holmes (NOAA Fisheries Open Science lead, a 3-year initiative by the NOAA Fish Office of Science & Tech); Ileana Fenwick (Pathways to Open Science lead & a fierce advocate for HBCU fairness); Luis López (NASA Openscapes cloud infrastructure lead & develops open source tools).\n\n\n\n\n\nIleana and Julie representing Openscapes at the White House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognition Challenge winners on the Navy Steps of the EEOB.\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes made a 7-minute statement; we quoted Dr. Justin Rice (Deputy Manager at NASA Earth Science) and Dr. Evan Howell (Director, Office of Science and Technology at NOAA Fisheries) about the impact of Openscapes on their agencies; shared about the Flywheel & forking as the first step, as well as Champions & Pathways to Open Science programs.\n\n\n“The impact that Openscapes has had in the last 2 years is unprecedented at NASA” — Dr. Justin Rice, Deputy Project Manager for Data Systems for NASA Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS)\n\n\n\n\n“Over the month or two I thought about the proposal, I met numerous people in the field involved in this initiative, and *everyone* was positive and supportive of the endeavor, which is something I don’t think I’ve ever experienced in my career to date.” — Dr. Evan Howell, Director, Office of Science and Technology at NOAA Fisheries\n\n\nOur big ask was that people need to be paid to learn, teach, contribute to open source, and collaborate across organizations - there aren’t enough examples of what a sustainable career in open science looks like. If we’re asking people to change the way they work for open science, we need to change the way we work too – what levers can we pull with contracts, procurement, and reporting to fund that work and make it enduring. Ileana also underscored how important investing in HBCUs is, as they provide a huge proportion of our workforce.\n\n\n\nJulie and Ileana in Vice President Kamala Harris’ office!\n\n\nWatch the Community Call recording and browse the collaborative notes to hear more about The White House, our experiences, and the other awesome groups recognized there. You’ll also hear reflections about the Open Science Dynamic Convergence Workshop that we attended, organized by the Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA), in collaboration with CERN and UNESCO and with the participation of NASA and the National Science Foundation. This was a real international group and exciting to engage with open science on a more global scale. The collaborative notes also have Julie’s talking points from the panel."

    "text": "NASA Openscapes Mentors Aaron Friesz, Andy Barrett, Danny Kaufman, Rhys Leahy, Alexis Hunzinger, with Julia Lowndes are co-leading this session at the ESIP Summer 2024 meeting.\nESIP Meeting theme: Grounded in Trust: Data Ethics Empower Collaboration\nDetails on the ESIP site.\nPurpose of our session: Facilitate a space to find common challenges & solutions for “moving to the cloud”, which includes onboarding people to a shared compute space and fledging them to their own space. We will share stories of how people go from 0 to Hub and then fledge to other clouds. Have mechanisms to hear many voices and come up with creative solutions. We will also invite people to contribute (earthaccess, Cookbook) and how we onboard. Share stories of how people go from 0 to Hub and then fledge to other cloud. \nOutcomes from our session: Learn from participants: what are challenges encountered from onboarding & fledging? Co-design solutions. Blog post - summary posted on ESIP/NASA-Openscapes blog. We’ll include authors from Roll Call unless you’d prefer to opt out; we’ll share a draft beforehand. \nProcess: Stories from NASA Openscapes (30 min); Breakout groups (25 min); Discussion (25 min)\n\n\nNASA Openscapes is a community where staff with similar roles supporting users across 12 NASA Earth Science Data Centers (DAACs) – through building trust – have been able to learn, develop common tutorials, and teach together to support users migrating workflows using NASA Earthdata to the Cloud. NASA Openscapes Mentors co-create and maintain an open Earthdata Cloud Cookbook of common reusable open source tutorials that they have co-developed for specific audiences and tested and refined through frequent workshops, hackathons, and Openscapes Champions Cohorts. We also created the earthaccess Python library which made users’ first experience with NASA Earthdata Cloud be two lines of Python code rather than 30 lines of bash code (that also required clicking and managing hidden files for authentication). The work we do together as a small community has enormous cascading effects, particularly as they visibly practice open science daily via contributions to open source code and documentation. We have supported hundreds of users to have their first hands-on experience with NASA Earthdata in the Cloud in a 2i2c JupyterHub configured for Jupyter, RStudio, MATLAB, and QGIS using our tutorials and docker base images (set up for libraries/environments, Quarto, etc). As the purpose of our JupyterHub is initial learning and exploration, we are now focused on “fledging” – answering the question “where do researchers go when they leave the Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub?” We will share first stories of researchers shifting to their own cloud spaces, attaching their university credit cards in order to do science at scale in the cloud. We will share stories and challenges, and how approaches fit and can be leveraged by the ESIP community."

His main takeaways:\n\nFinds cloud to be “a super power”\n\nNew science questions: can process data too big to imagine processing in current places\nDetails: “I did an analysis for my AGU poster: 150 TB of L1 and L2 data, and I only needed some tiny fraction that were of interest to me. In the old way I would need to find a way to download it all first, and I don’t have a machine big enough. But parallelizing with Coiled, I can subset. Now once I realize that, I realize there are bigger datasets that just seemed unworkable before.” - Aronne Merrelli\n\nCloud costs: cheaper than expected\n\nMatt Rocklin’s “Rule of Thumb”: $0.10 per TB, so processing 150 TB would be roughly $15\nThinking for grant proposals: ~$100s/yr will go a long way\n\nInfrastructure: less intensive than expected\n\nShifting workflow to earthaccess then parallelizing with Coiled. Little setup required\n\n\nAronne describes himself as a Level 1 or Level 2 algorithm scientist. He had been interested in learning how to use the cloud and had some previous unhelpful experiences, since most discussions revolved around the administration of cloud services that made it seem like there was a large overhead to using the cloud, including specialized packages that seemed hard to use, or inefficient on datasets he uses."

Eli Holmes (NOAA Fisheries) led the Crossing the Chasm session at ESIP last week, presenting how ideas spread through an organization and the challenging gap between early adopters and broader adoption.

And while there are new challenges in the face of budget uncertainties and a lack of sustained funding, the intentional culture and community building remains critical to the library’s success. We can now flip the question of how to support earthaccess, and instead ask: How can earthaccess support NASA Earthdata? Amy concluded by sharing a vision we’re building of “earthaccess with batteries included” (credit to Andy Barrett, NSIDC) and “Widening the bridge”, inviting contributors shape the future!\n\n\n\nearthaccess statictics: enabling reproducibility of workflows, collaboration, and transparency.\n\n\nAmy emphasized how partnerships are critical. She shared how earthaccess won the ESIP FUNding Friday $5k, an annual mini-competition awarding small projects that are inspired by ESIP collaboration or participation. We plan to use funds to host an earthaccess hackathon at the AGU December meeting - virtually and in person!

    "text": "New features and VirtualiZarr\nJoe Kennedy’s presentation on virtual datasets focused on how cloud computing paradigms enable small teams to generate near real-time mission-scale derived data products. He showed how virtual datasets are used by the ITS_LIVE project to provide low-latency access to global glacier velocity data from multiple optical, radar, and laser satellite sensors. This is achieved by extracting time series of measurements from a particular location and computing velocities by measuring the distance moved over time. Zarr datasets support this targeted extraction natively. Virtual datasets make this possible for other data storage formats by utilizing metadata (via the kerchunk python library) that allows extraction of data for a particular location and time, rather than having to process the entire granules.\nJoe put forward a vision where earthaccess can generalize this access pattern for all datasets. This work is underway through integrating VirtualiZarr and Icechunk into earthaccess. He emphasized critical challenges in implementing virtual datasets effectively. The core issue is that cloud optimization isn’t just about file formats - it’s fundamentally about aligning data organization with data access patterns. Data providers face difficult trade-offs: chunking data temporally optimizes time series analysis but degrades spatial access performance, and vice versa. Additional complexities include handling authentication, and navigating institutional policies around data egress and regional deployments. Joe stressed that success requires alignment between data providers, services, and community adoption."

    "section": "Deeper specifics with VirtualiZarr",
    "text": "Deeper specifics with VirtualiZarr\nChris Battisto talked about updating and managing VirtualiZarr stores using Icechunk. He highlighted two main approaches for creating Earth data cubes using xarray with NASA Earth data: direct Zarr store access with spatial/temporal subsetting (which requires being in AWS US-West-2), and individual granule download and concatenation (common but memory and storage-bound).\nHe then explained a third way: Create virtualized datasets with VirtualiZarr, and store (and update) with Icechunk. While virtualized datasets offer significant advantages in terms of scalability and efficiency, Chris noted there are still challenges in getting them to work with all NASA Earth data collections. He encouraged the community to experiment with these tools and share their experiences through the earthaccess GitHub repository, and provided documentation links for getting started with both VirtualiZarr and Icechunk implementations.\nNext, Danny Kaufman presented on using virtual datasets with TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution) data. TEMPO monitors air pollution over North America and generates substantial data volumes: approximately 10 Level-2 (L2 - non-gridded) granules per hour and about 5,000 Level-3 (L3 - gridded) granules (2.5 TB)  annually. Danny found that L3 data products worked well with earthaccess’s virtual dataset implementation, which substantially reduced data access time from about one day when downloading to just ~10 minutes. This dramatic improvement was possible because L3 TEMPO data has both consistent dimension sizes and pre-generated DMR++ reference files, which contain chunk manifests with byte ranges for efficient S3 access. In contrast, L2 TEMPO data failed to work as virtual datasets because of inconsistent dimension sizes across granules, which isn’t compatible with current Zarr specifications. \nDanny showed that roughly 15% (given several caveats) of NASA Earthdata collections have the necessary DMR++ files that are both downloadable and parseable by VirtualiZarr. To further streamline access, the team is working on creating combined reference files that don’t rely on DMR++ for the entire Level 3 TEMPO collection. As with all of these initiatives, Danny emphasized that documentation and community learning remain crucial for broader adoption."

    "text": "Bringing It Home\nLuis Lopez brought us home with a presentation focused on earthaccess’s role as a bridge between the current state of NASA Earth Data and a future cloud-native, analysis-ready archive. He emphasized that earthaccess serves as a crucial abstraction layer that helps scientists navigate the complexities of NASA’s data systems. Currently, the library is working to implement smart data access patterns, particularly through virtual data cubes, to enable efficient scientific analysis whether users need time series data or multi-file operations. The immediate technical priorities include handling distributed authentication, optimizing metadata reads, and improving I/O operations.\nLooking forward, Luis highlighted a fundamental shift in thinking about NASA’s data challenges, quoting Patrick Quinn: “Stop Building Tools. Start Fixing Data.”. He stressed that data should be harmonized and optimized at the source, which would reduce the need for numerous APIs and workarounds. The overarching mission for earthaccess is to continue bridging the gap between the current fragmented state of NASA data archives and an ideal future where data can be accessed with the same simple three lines of code regardless of the underlying complexity. This vision aligns with the broader goal of preserving simplicity for users while handling the technical challenges behind the scenes."

It has also been a lot. Like everyone, I have been consumed with the weight of everything going on in the world, local and global, including wildfires growing nearby my house right now. My theme this year is “default to open” as I grow as a leader in the same way I do as a scientist. This post feels like a long time in the making in that lens. But it has been great to share about different pieces of this with some of you, and it feels really good to document it all more here. I hope you’re all doing ok, and please get in touch - my best email is julia at openscapes.org. Cheers, Julie Lowndes."

    "text": "OPENSCAPES ETHOS\nOpenscapes is an approach and community that helps researchers and those supporting research find each other and feel empowered to conduct data-intensive science. We support open science as “kinder science for future us”: the vision is a scientific culture that is more efficient, more kind, and more collaborative, and that can uncover solutions faster together to the most pressing climate and social challenges. Our main activity is mentorship to build open source technical and collaborative leadership skills within and across teams and organizations, connecting groups and role-modeling open practices that are critical elements to helping shift towards open science. All our lessons, curriculum, writing (blog posts, peer reviewed publications, slides, etc) are open source and shared publicly online – using the same tools we teach for data analysis and reproducible reports (GitHub, Quarto/RMarkdown, R, Python, Jupyter, Google Drive). We believe role-modeling open practices is critical to helping teams shift towards open science.\nOpenscapes is motivated by a question: What if we connected our skills & values in our daily work, for solutions to our most pressing climate challenges? We work with actionable science teams at agencies like NASA Earth Science, NOAA Fisheries, EPA, California Water Boards, academic and non-profit groups like the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, Black in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science and Black in Marine Science. In our work we think that combining data science with open science with teamwork & community, is a way for us all to help address our climate emergency. As Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and Katharine Wilkinson say in the book All We Can Save: “To address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape society. We need every solution and every solver”."

    "section": "IGNITING REAL CULTURE CHANGE ACROSS SCIENCE",
    "text": "IGNITING REAL CULTURE CHANGE ACROSS SCIENCE\nWe are seeing real culture change across science through the Openscapes approach. This is a big deal and something I am really proud of. Change shows up as real improvements in how individuals, teams, and organizations operate. We see researchers’ daily efficiency and wellbeing benefit whole organizations since there is less time wasted, errors are identified and fixed earlier, and staff have less burnout and turnover. Through the Champions Program, we’ve seen a senior administrator who had participated for weeks on mute suddenly unmute, lean forward, and say “I need that, can you teach me?” when a colleague was screensharing their workflow for automating data-intensive reports. Through NASA Openscapes co-led with Erin Robinson, we have changed the way NASA teaches how to access Earthdata in the cloud. With NASA, NOAA, and the California Water Boards, we are supporting within-government open source community development that flourishes across historical institutional silos: examples include the earthaccess python library, Dr. Eli Holmes’s new 3-year position as NOAA Fisheries Open Science Lead, and the California Environmental Protection Agency’s (CalEPA) open data strategy (see the upcoming July Executive Director Report: https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_info/exec_dir_rpts).\n2023 marked 5 years of Openscapes! We have done and learned a lot – look out for an upcoming blog post with more details. But to share some – in early 2024, Openscapes was mentioned in the White House Fact Sheet as the Biden-⁠Harris Administration Marks the Anniversary of OSTP’s Year of Open Science! We’ve led 155 science teams through our flagship Champions program, upskilled 90 Mentors across several government organizations, and welcomed 120 Black marine and environmental scientists to Open Science through the Pathways Program. We’ve also led two years of the Reflections program, a lower-commitment way for people to participate in Openscapes and build open science skills. But real culture change is less about us leading events and more about the Openscapes approach and Flywheel spinning around the world as people practice, reuse, and teach it themselves. Openscapes has been successful because we are small, independent, and outside the organizations we work with, and teaching approaches that can be incorporated within organizations (for example with the CalEPA). We are keeping that going."

    "section": "AN OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY",
    "text": "AN OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY\nI’ve come to think of Openscapes itself as an open source community, which yes, might be obvious, and was the goal all along. But I realize it actually is. We as a community — and linked to many other communities all along the open spectrum — are all role modeling open, living open science as a process and daily activity (not only a product at the end), and bringing reuse and extension as a value of open. It’s happening!\nPart of the community being open source is that all our resources are open source; you’re welcome to them. We think of the Flywheel as an open source tool — I reach for the Flywheel when we are planning, designing programs, communicating impact, just as I reach for R and Quarto and JupyterHubs when I am doing data analysis. We also invest heavily in open documentation: through the Champions Lesson Series resources and the Approach Guide that document how we work and facilitate – these are other open source resources to reuse and extend, the way you would an R or Python package. It takes real work and time to make things open – that means posting on YouTube and formatting for GitHub rather than a PDF sitting in a corner of our laptops. Funding supports our time working with partners, and also invests in this work to keep the Flywheel going.\n“Forking” is a concept from GitHub and software programming where you can copy someone’s work into your own space to reuse/remix/extend it. It is still attached to the original source so that you can be connected, give credit, and also contribute back, if your changes might be useful to the original project. We are thrilled to see people “forking Openscapes” like teaching from each other’s slide decks, copying live notes and agenda structure, and reusing Champions cohorts and event structure to better suit audiences, like the CalEPA has done."

    "section": "OUR CORE TEAM",
    "text": "OUR CORE TEAM\nOpenscapes has an intentionally small core team. As we have grown, we have tried to keep a deliberately flattened organizational structure that works effectively and has the impact of a much bigger team. We define the core team right now as people who are paid directly from Openscapes funds (grants & contracts). Sustainability of people’s workload and financing is front of mind. Outside of me (aiming for 90% time), team members work up to 50% time, with everyone working as much as they want to. Our core team has shifted this year, and you’ll see these changes reflected in our website too.\nFirst, a huge thank you to Erin Robinson, who was instrumental in growing Openscapes into a sustainable initiative via her expertise in strategic sustainability planning and her leadership with the NASA Earthdata community. Erin Robinson has shifted off the core team: she is currently finishing her PhD in Information Science focused on knowledge infrastructures for Earth and environmental science applications and consulting with her company Metadata Game Changers. I have learned so much working together with Erin, it could be a whole book in itself. I’m so proud of the Openscapes Flywheel we developed together and that Jim Collins responded to us saying he was excited about our work when we shared our 2023 Earth Science Data Systems Working Group (ESDSWG) slides! Erin, I can’t wait to see what you do and where you take this all next, and continue to stay connected with us all.\nGrowing our team, we’ve welcomed two new team members: Liz Neeley and Andy Teucher! Both Liz and Andy have backgrounds as environmental scientists, so they are closely connected with researchers and understand deeply the challenges and opportunities as we work with teams, and are huge wonderful additions to the Openscapes Community.\nLiz Neeley brings a deep background of science communication and sense making, and is supporting me as well as NASA Mentors. The first thing we did together is Liz helped design a hiring rubric and interview conversation guides for our cloud position with 26 applicants earlier this year — this is something I had never done before and I learned a lot (blog post upcoming!) Liz is also a founding partner of the new initiative Liminal, which is a science communication collective. I am proud to say that I am part of the collective, alongside some amazing leaders. Liz and I have already co-chaired a workshop with the NIH National Libraries of Medicine, and I shared some of Openscapes’ work in environmental and Earth science communities. I am excited to contribute, learn, connect, and bring back what I learn to the Openscapes community.\nAndy Teucher is a data scientist and open source developer and teacher, and has been focused on cloud infrastructure with NASA Openscapes. In just a few short months already he has identified ways to lower costs for cloud computing and storage. And, making this immediately actionable, he has taught tutorials on technical and policy approaches to reduce costs for scientists and JupyterHub managers, which is so awesome. Andy is continuing to document this and identify other ways to contribute to reduce friction for users learning to access and use NASA Earthdata in the cloud. A current focus is on “fledging” — where do researchers go to do their real science once they have tested whether the Cloud is right for them through our 2i2c JupyterHub? (Look out for a blog post following our July ESIP session!)\nStefanie Butland and Ileana Fenwick and I continue to work closely together, across Openscapes activities. Ileana led the second annual Pathways to Open Science program with co-leads Aneese Williams and Alex Davis earlier this year, reusing what worked and extending the program activities. Ileana, Stef and I led the second year of the Reflections Program as well, and are excited to continue to have new channels and sponsorship so people have friendly entryways to engage with open science. Stefanie has led more and more core activities, doing all setup for Champions Cohorts, teaching lessons, supporting NASA mentors and coworking, and designing and leading the new Quarto + GitHub Contributing Clinic. Look out for Stef’s talk at posit::conf next month about how we use Sean Kross’s Kyber R package to save time and reduce manual errors in Champions Cohorts setup!\nAll of us work closely with Mentors and Champions and others in the greater Openscapes and open science community, and we appreciate you!"

    "section": "STRUCTURE",
    "text": "STRUCTURE\nIn 2022 I started Openscapes LLC as a mechanism to administer funds to support the Openscapes open source community. In my mind, the LLC is not synonymous with all the Openscapes community work described above, it is one piece supporting the community. Openscapes LLC is a value-driven vehicle to try to support open science as a career – a sustainable and lasting career — for myself and for others. An LLC was a mechanism that was possible for me. I do sometimes feel like I have to justify this choice, and I push back on the idea that companies are inherently bad or that non-profits uniquely embody the values of open science (see Chris Hartgerink’s eloquent post about this (Not-)for-profit in research). I see many people wondering how to make open science a sustainable job and we need more pathways – it’s important to be able to explore and discuss mechanisms together as an open community. So how is Openscapes LLC value-driven? We are not motivated by profit. We pay people for their time, we pay quickly, and aim to pay them well. We can work pro-bono at times to collaborate with partners, as we do with the Pathways for Open Science Program. We can also donate to causes aligned with our values. Since we believe that open science plays a critical role in climate solutions, we joined 1% for the Planet and starting later in 2024 will donate at least 1% of revenue each year to environmental non-profits. This will be small, but small numbers matter, as does visibly connecting our values with how we work.\nAnd, I am now full time at Openscapes LLC! In May 2024 I shifted to an affiliate position at NCEAS/UC Santa Barbara, after working as a Project Scientist there for 11 years (2013-2024). I love the community and teams at NCEAS - the Ocean Health Index in particular as my open science origins (see 2021 SORTEE slides) along with the admin staff. From undergrad to PhD to NCEAS, I have been at universities since 1999, and this is a big shift for me. And I also feel prepared as I continue developing as a scientist, open science champion, feminist, anti-racist, and human, throughout all these years with all the people I have learned from and worked with along the way. So some underlying structure of my situation has changed, but Openscapes’ momentum is unchanged. \nBeing a small business owner and designing Openscapes values into the business structure is something I am really proud of. It feels different in some ways compared to being a scientist, but in fact I am solidly both. It has been a lot of work to build and manage a company and I continue to learn really important skills to support the work — and I have not done it alone! I so greatly value my accounting & contracts team, as well as my leadership coach and advisors. And so many practical conversations from people I admire in this community. And, I think that Openscapes LLC is a step. I would like the mechanism to administer funds on the back end to match the community approach on the front end. I am eyeing a collaborative structure in a not-too-distant future, and have talked with some of you about this already (and I am learning from Liminal this way as well). However, we’ll take it one step at a time. We are dedicated and in this for the long-haul: Openscapes LLC is a “keepgoing”, not a startup, to borrow language from open source community lead Greg Wilson."

    "text": "QUESTIONS WE’RE PONDERING\nWe are deeply interested in the “so what” of open science. So teams are more efficient and morale is higher, science is more reproducible, data are more FAIR. So what – is response to wildfires faster, with partners and residents better informed due to open data and sharing? Are communities developing solutions to water management also working on the other side of the world due to trust built and amplified? In my own neighborhood, I see wildfire communications vastly improved because of open data, and groups sharing information and visualizations openly. Fewer neighbors message to ask “where/how big”? And the conversations shift to what to do and how to help each other. This is because they can see the data easily themselves and are informed. I am ready for Openscapes to contribute to stories like these, for the Flywheel to spin for climate and social solutions. We’re in a moment where open science is still “new”, shifting from its early adopter moment to the early majority, so it feels early and energizing and new. And, at the same time, people have been working on this for decades, and there is an impatience for us to really gain traction and identify and tell these stories to connect us and unite us in hope and action due to all that we’ve done with open science. It’s about people, and we’re ready.\nI’ll end here for now, thank you for reading. There is so much more learned and on my mind and plate and I look forward to continue collaborating and making a difference with you all. I’m nothing but excited for going forward together.\n\n\n\nLlanwrst, Wales, photo by Julie Lowndes"

On February 26, the authors co-presented at the NASA Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Tech Spotlight meeting — to a crowd of 88 people! The author list is testament to this open community of developers: Luis López, Matt Fisher and Amy Steiker are at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), Aaron Friesz is at the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC), and Qiusheng Wu is at University of Tennessee and an active open science community leader. This is a brief post to share resources and a few highlights - we encourage you to review the slides, recording, repos, and notebooks below. Additionally, please join this open science community effort via regular remote hackdays!\nQuicklinks:\n\nslides - slides co-presented by the authors\nrecording\nearthaccess and the cloud: the force awakens notebook - from Luis’ demo\nOpenGeos: NASA-Earth-Data GitHub repository - from Qiusheng’s demo\nleafmap: nasa earth data notebook - from Qiusheng’s demo\nBi-weekly hackdays, Announcement and ongoing discussions for more info.\n\n\nAmy Steiker began the presentation framing the problems that earthaccess addresses: data accessibility, API fragmentation, and authentication in the cloud.\n\n\n\nearthaccess eliminates the need to know the intricacies of NASA’s Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and cloud data storage systems.\n\n\nShe described earthaccess as a community, with roots in the NASA Openscapes community where staff with similar roles supporting users across the DAACs (NASA data centers) have been able to learn, develop common tutorials, and teach together.\n\n\n\nThe earthaccess design came from learning/responding to researcher pain points from cross-DAAC Hackathons and Champions Cohorts\n\n\n\n\n\nThis community strategy is a theme and enabler of earthaccess growth and utilization.\n\n\nAaron Friesz then shared about Earthdata Authentication - Old vs New. The old approach was 30 lines of code, where the user also had to interface with the Earthdata login site. earthaccess now replaces this with 1 line of code. Plus, earthaccess also takes care of AWS credentials.\nLP DAAC uses earthaccess in all of its tutorials and teaching events, including ECOSTRESS and EMIT workshops and hackathons. It has changed the way they work, develop, and teach.\nLuis López, earthaccess lead developer, then shared about scaling in the cloud using earthaccess from a earthaccess and the cloud: the force awakens notebook. He shared how earthaccess interfaces between DAACs-AWS and open science community resources.\n\n\n\nearthaccess interfaces between DAACs-AWS and open science community resources.\n\n\nLuis demo’ed many parts of earthaccess:\n\nAccess remote files, automatically handling authentication and serialization.\nGenerate an on-the-fly Zarr compatible cache with Kerchunk!\nSmart Access - Sneak peak today, more details at SciPy 2024!\nScale out workflows with Dask - Processing Terabyte-Scale NASA Cloud Datasets with Coiled\n\nLuis demo’d upcoming features in development for earthaccess that reduce egress sizes (saves NASA $$) and time to science! This is incredibly exciting!\nEgress:\n without earthaccess: 3199.29 MB \n with earthaccess   :  112.0 MB\n\nTime to science:\n without earthaccess: 15.9 minutes \n with earthaccess   :  0.52 minutes\nQiusheng Wu then shared earthaccess in action with leafmap. Qiusheng built the NASA Earth Data Catalog on top of earthaccess, which uses GitHub Actions to pull the most recent metadata records for NASA Earthdata. Then, using leafmap — Python package for geospatial analysis and interactive mapping in a Jupyter environment that Qiusheng developed — users can interact and view the metadata on a map, exploring and selecting to find the data they want.\nThis is so exciting to have earthaccess involved as the 88th notebook example in the leafmap resource list! You can click to launch the notebook in different coding environments, including Google Colab.\nearthaccess has a lot of momentum moving forward as an open science community, and we welcome you to join our bi-weekly hackdays: fostering new contributions through small group work aligning around specific topics or features.

    "text": "We want to share our work in a way that people can find it, use it, improve it, and cite it, or get credit for their contributions. For people who have participated in our programs like Openscapes Champions1, or Pathways to Open Science2, we want a robust way to add these to their CV as professional development. For contributors to our open educational resources, like the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook3, we want them to get credit and visibility. For people who want to reuse or remix a slide from a presentation, we want them to feel great about it by providing an easy way to cite the presentation. To enable all of this, we created a Zenodo Openscapes Community as a semantically meaningful group of selected research products. NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) and the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement’s (CSCCE) Zenodo Communities were inspirations for ours.\nZenodo is a general-purpose open repository that allows researchers to deposit research related digital artefacts like research papers, data sets, research software, reports, lesson materials, and presentations. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citable (adapted from Wikipedia). Zenodo allows for versioning and we can preserve GitHub repositories in Zenodo too (GitHub itself is not a repository!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes Approach Guide gives instructions for our use cases, with pointers for things that might not be obvious to a first-time user.\n\nWhat do we curate in our Zenodo Openscapes Community?\nHow to add your existing Zenodo record to the Zenodo Openscapes Community\nHow to publish a new record in Zenodo to get a DOI\nHow to get a DOI for materials on GitHub\nHow to cite Openscapes publications\n\n\n\n\nOf course I want credit for my contributions! When we add an author’s ORCID ID to a Zenodo record, their ORCID profile is automatically updated. I learned of this bonus when I uploaded a post on which I’m a co-author, and then received email notification that this record had been added to my ORCID profile. Why is this so cool? An ORCID ID is a unique, open digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher with the same or a similar name to you. My ORCID profile is a bit like a CV. I use it to collect my research publications (not limited to peer reviewed papers) along with things like education and service on boards. Having it automatically updated is great.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociating a Zenodo record with an author’s ORCID ID results in that record being automatically listed in their ORCID profile.\n\n\nWant to create a Zenodo Community? Play in the Sandbox first, where anyone can create and refine a draft Community before publishing it in Zenodo. Creating a Sandbox version forced me to recognize decisions to make before creating the real thing, like: needing to create it from an account that looks professional like “curator”, rather than my personal email username; or deciding what types of research products to include or exclude. This webinar section “How to create a community” screenshares a walk-through that makes things crystal clear."

    "text": "On December 15, 2025 we led a hackday funded by ESIP (Earth Science Information Partners), in collaboration with CNG (Cloud Native Geospatial) and Openscapes. 41 people participated, with 14 in person and 27 joining remotely. 22 co-leads and facilitators from many organizations were critical to its success, including six NASA DAACs (Earthdata Data Centers), Development Seed, UC Berkeley Center for Data Science & Environment, University of New Hampshire, ESIP, and Openscapes. This blog post is focusing on the people, structure, and mechanics behind the hackday – the reality of how we put this together. This was a HUGE collaborative effort with folks stepping up to help facilitate and lead, with limited time. We are proud of the people we brought together, and what we accomplished. Thank you all facilitators – all are co-authors! We plan to share outcomes from the hackday at the July 2026 ESIP Summer Meeting in Austin Texas.\nQuicklinks:"

    "text": "Goals\nThe goal we pitched to ESIP’s FUNding Friday was to build a prototype and roadmap for “Growing the Family” by integrating earthaccess with non-NASA Earth science data (NOAA, USGS, Copernicus, and more!). We designed the event to focus on building the community of earthaccess contributors and adopters; we were equally interested in growing ideas as much as we were interested in developing technology to support earthaccess growth. For those new to earthaccess, it’s a Python library that simplifies access to NASA Earth science data, turning complex authentication and data discovery into just a few lines of code. It’s becoming essential infrastructure for researchers working with Earth observation data, and with this hackday, we wanted to expand its community and expand its reach beyond NASA to other Earth science data providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoomie (Zoom selfie) of virtual and in-person hackday participants (with earthaccess hex stickers!)."

We shared four tracks in advance as topics folks might want to focus on:\n\nSTAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs) Integrations – “Growing the Family”\nUser Stories – Understanding Pain Points and Priorities\nUser Onboarding and LLM Support\nData Virtualization\n\nLeads opened GitHub Issues or Discussions for tracks so that folks could consider and discuss these in advance. This is part of lowering barriers to participation, but also capturing progress, notes, and discussions.\nWe had a Zoom breakout room for each track (everyone was logged into Zoom to be more inclusive of remote participants). We had one Agenda document (screenshot) with Tabs for each track, and time at the beginning, middle, and end for all tracks to come back together in the Main room and share out.\n\n\n“It is amazing to see all the specialists working together to address the real, unprepared needs of the participants…The shared notes document was the best part—it captured all the details, including questions, answers, and links, from every group and participant.” - Alexys H Rodríguez, participant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of our Agenda document with live notes; we used Google Document Tabs along the left navigation bar to have notes for each Track (Room)."

    "text": "Planning the hackday\nPlanning the hackday was a study in how generous people fuel collaboration across groups, reusing (“forking”) existing structures and using existing communication channels, and being comfortable with “good enough” given the time and resources we had. For example, some folks were only able to lead during a portion of the session time, and many were not able to fully polish slidedecks ahead of time. Our event planning phase was during the government shutdown, so we were missing people, and others were over-taxed with responsibilities. Even so, folks prioritized time where they could, and we focused on communicating openly and early to invite participants to sign up and also to coordinate our facilitator team and design the plan. CNG created a registration page for participant sign-ups that we shared with our communities. We coordinated largely through a single spreadsheet where we listed “hackday facilitators” (earthaccess maintainers and NASA Openscapes Mentor community) and mapped out availability and roles.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the spreadsheet we used to coordinate in-person and online facilitators in lead and helper roles.\n\n\n\nHackday funds from ESIP went to the venue rentals for the hackday and social hour, smoothly coordinated by CNG. Hackdays cost more than $5K, however, and this did not compensate for the time for the 22 facilitators involved. Their time was generously covered “in kind” by their employers (listed in the preface).\nWe have survey responses that will help us support earthaccess adopters and contributors – and help us lead successful events in the future."

    "text": "Building Community, not just Code\nThere is so much value in the people and organizations working together to lead this event, it’s impossible to overstate. We saw our approach have impact: building a welcoming contributor community (users are contributors!) around a transformative python library supported by technical and human infrastructure. Diverse participants, some who’ve already been involved and some new to earthaccess who were keen to collaborate came from many different organizations, including NASA DAACs, DevelopmentSeed, UCBerkeley, Earthscope hub, and NOAA. They were developers, contributors, newcomers, users, learners. People joined from across the US, and from Poland, India, and Canada.\nSeveral people indicated they were new to earthaccess and for some this was their first-ever hackday! We aimed to “grow the family” and ease people’s introduction by running a 2-day event in November - A welcome to NASA Earthdata and earthaccess. Day 1 consisted of lessons and demos and Day 2 had people getting hands-on experience by running those demos themselves in breakout rooms they chose. This clearly lowered some barriers to hackday participation and contribution to earthaccess in general. One participant joined the November event, where she got more familiar with contributing, joined our biweekly earthaccess hackdays, and then contributed in this hackday. She’s now a full contributor with pull requests merged into earthaccess!"

We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science3, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\nOpenscapes Champions is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. For NASA Openscapes, participants also spend time experimenting and planning what their analytical workflows with NASA Earthdata look like in the Cloud.\nNASA Openscapes is a project to support scientists using data from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud. As part of this work, we will offer the Openscapes Champions program several times from 2024-2026."

We are modifying the traditional Champions structure to be more light-weight so that participants can engage at whatever level they can (rather than the full cohort-based model of usual Champions programs). Following the Fall 2025 events, in Winter 2026 we will lead a 4-Part Series of Community Calls and Coworking sessions, likely February - April. Details and registration coming by November 2025."

    "text": "2025 goals\nOur 2025 focus is strengthening NASA networks between DAACs, missions, training programs, and applications, aligned with SPD-41a open science, as we continue to support users through developing skills and tools. 2025 goals were determined by Mentors during our Fall 2024 Mentors Retreat.\nWe will move forward on the following four interlinking goals. Below is a brief overview of the purpose, outcomes, and process of each, and how to join us.\n\n1. User support and co-development\n\nPurpose: Supporting users in the Cloud, which requires infrastructure and skills. Skills include mindset shifts, as well as new technical and collaboration skills. Infrastructure requires co-developing software and resources as well as providing a JupyterHub compute space for developing tutorials and teaching workshops, which we do in partnership with 2i2c. The goal is to “make once, use often”, reusing materials and iterating and improving upon them as a distributed group of mentors who learn with, from, and for each other.\nOutcomes: Users have a friendly onboarding experience using NASA Earthdata in the cloud. Users develop good practices for sustained work in the cloud, including parallelizing code, managing storage, and understanding cloud costs and options for “fledging” from our workshop Hub.\nProcess: We lead well-planned, welcoming, user-designed teaching events in a variety of formats including in-person and online (hackathons, workshops, Champions Cohorts, Community Calls, conference sessions). To prepare for these events, we develop open documentation, slides, and tutorials that are available for reuse and remix; we host a JupyterHub compute space in partnership with 2i2c; we co-develop technical cloud technical infrastructure including scientific software docker images, user access administration, cost reports/tracking, and documentation of user stories. We develop together asynchronously and synchronously via hackdays and coworking.\n\nTo join teaching events: Check our News & Events page for registration, available in late summer.\nTo join hackdays/coworking: Check our Cloud infrastructure GitHub to get involved in biweekly hackdays.\n\n\n\n\n2. earthaccess python library\n\nPurpose: To continue growth and sustainability of this python library that is used by 100’s of projects and 1000’s of users for accessing NASA Earthdata programmatically. earthaccess simplifies data discovery and access to NASA Earthdata by providing an abstraction layer to NASA’s APIs for programmatic access (CMR and EDL). It has complements in R and MATLAB that we can develop further.\nOutcomes: More users can easily access NASA Earthdata. Increased community engagement via developing scaffolding to reduce participation barriers (education and outreach); Software sustainability and maintenance and further feature development including integrating VirtualiZarr, testing on Cloud OPeNDAP-enabled collections (DMR++ compliance/consistency), building a plugin interface for services like Harmony, developing a “Results” Class that will be interoperable with the STAC ecosystem, using earthaccess for download scripts from Earthdata Search, and developing a Command Line Interface (CLI).\nProcess: Community-driven and community-requested development, currently including contributors from multiple DAACs, NASA, and the open science community. We develop asynchronously as well as via biweekly hackdays. We also share progress and features via continued talks and events to support users and showcase capabilities.\n\nTo join: The earthaccess contributing guide shares information about asynchronous contributions, joining biweekly hackdays, and the Zulip messaging board.\n\n\n\n\n3. Champions Cohort (Fall 2025)\n\nPurpose: To support users using NASA Earthdata in science workflows from multiple data centers, taught and supported by Mentors who get to understand user needs deeply and co-develop solutions. Potentially earthaccess-focused to support users programmatically.\nOutcomes: Users learn skills for current best practices for using NASA Earthdata and are empowered to ask questions and work more collaboratively within and across teams. Users have more awareness of what is available, what is coming, and how to get involved as contributors.\nProcess: This flagship Openscapes Champions program has been led 27 times since 2019, with 3 previous Cohorts co-led with NASA Mentors. We will lead this year’s Cohort in Fall 2025, giving time to align with ESDIS and NASA Earth Action’s goals and communities. As there is current instability in our user communities, we will focus the spring and summer on developing relationships with user groups and restructuring the Champions Cohorts to best meet user needs.\n\nTo join: Check our News & Events page for registration, available in late summer.\n\n\n\n\n4. Earthdata Cloud Cookbook\n\nPurpose: A curated collection of tutorials and documentation that focus on the common steps across DAACs and users. It is available for self-paced learning with links back to the underlying GitHub repository where it is developed and able to be reused and remixed. It is under active, open development. We are reaching a lot of users with workshops and our compiled resources; how can we continue to improve those events and resources?\nOutcomes: A better-maintained resource that has contributors beyond the Mentors and a broadened set of users. What if we opened the scope beyond “cloud” and included other common Earthdata tutorials?\nProcess: Throughout all our user support, we trial materials with users that help us to update and improve the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook. Tutorials, presentations, and approaches are added to the Cookbook based on latest user needs and trends/tooling. For example, we are adding more support for R users, and we are reporting openly on compute and storage costs so that they could allot cloud funding into future proposals. Most Cookbook development is motivated by teaching events (workshops and hackathons and Champions).\n\nTo join: Check our Cookbook GitHub Discussions; in Spring 2025 we are starting biweekly hackdays to drive more continual development alongside event-driven development. We are excited to build momentum with Development Seed contributions from VEDA. We can also collaborate with ESDIS for sharing cloud resources on the unified site, answering questions like: Does it need to be cloud-specific? Can it just be Earthdata specific?"

    "text": "How we work\nOpenscapes is about working effectively and openly as teams. We are user-focused and meet regularly to learn skills of immediate use together and to work on common needs for researchers using NASA Earthdata. We have an open science approach to resource development, where we focus on having space and place, sharing early and iterating with feedback, with a “make once, use often”, future us web-first mindset. Mentors build skills through Openscapes mentorship, co-developing events, software, and open practices and relationships with the open source community, with access to a JupyterHub that helps refine teaching strategies for Cloud.\n\n\n\nMentor Calls, Coworking, and Hackdays\nWe meet each week in different formats to move our work forward in different ways. The cadence in which we meet is available on our MainPlanning GitHub Project.\n\nMentor Calls for planning, sharing, and learning (biweekly, for Mentors)\nHackdays and Coworking for working synchronously and screensharing (biweekly, various topics, open to anyone!)\nAsynchronous work via 2i2c JupyterHub, GitHub, Slack, Google Drive. The majority of time is spent self-directed based on your goals, and you’ll be collaborating with others at your DAAC as well as across DAACs and the broader open science community.\n\n\n\nCalendar\n\nAll Year We have recurring biweekly Mentor Calls, Coworking sessions, and Hackdays.\nSummer and ESIP meeting - In July and August we planned to take a break from our biweekly calls to let this group rest. However, there was interest to keep the momentum and ability to collaborate with anyone available, so we have continued to host biweekly calls and move forward with AGU workshop proposals, and have guest speakers. In July many Mentors meet for the ESIP Summer Conference.\nFall Champions Cohort - We will support research teams to learn, discuss, and plan what transitioning their workflows with NASA Earthdata could look like in the Cloud. 2022-2024 Cohorts were during the Spring.\nFall - We regroup in Fall. Our initial call will include sharing plans, UWGs and other events on the calendar and continuing onboarding new DAAC mentors. In preparing for AGU workshops in December, returning DAAC mentors will lead teaching dry runs with the cloud tutorials as a way to onboard the group to data access in the cloud and to get your fresh perspective on our existing material. (What works? What’s confusing?).\n\n\n\nOnboarding Mentors\nInterested staff from the DAACs are welcome to join as Mentors at any time. Mentors teach and support in opportunities of different types, including Hackathons, Workshops, and the Openscapes Champions program. We expect a range of technical ability and teaching experience. Through these growth opportunities within a broader community engagement approach, Mentors will also gain visibility for their work as well as for their DAACs.\nPlease also see how we onboard documentation – this is part of the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook that is the main place for all cloud resources the Mentors are developing."

We led the 2024 cohort of science Champions (blog summary) as well as many mission and data specific workshops in person and online. We focused on “fledging” to explore the question of where do users go to do real science after they have learned in our 2i2c JupyterHub? We also continued collaborating with 2i2c and NOAA Fisheries to develop cloud in-frastructure to support NASA Earthdata users and explore costs per user and per science workflow (cloud infrastructure information).\n\n\nMentors Retreat 2024\nWe are excited to be hosting a NASA Openscapes Mentors Retreat Oct 16-17 2024 (remotely, online). Please share this email with your DAAC Managers. This retreat will bring together user support staff from across the DAACs that have engaged as leaders through NASA Openscapes and are helping users migrate workflows using NASA Earthdata to the cloud. It is also a way to onboard new user support staff as mentors. NASA Openscapes is not meant to be extra time, but time where people do their existing work in a different way – with open source science workflows to tackle common things together. We have seen the biggest momentum when there are 2-3 mentors at each DAAC, so that pairs/trios can work together within their DAAC as they bring back what they learn from cross-DAAC work. NASA Openscapes Lead Julie Lowndes is happy to email/meet with mentors and managers for any questions. Thank you to DAAC Managers and ESDIS for supporting staff in this way, it makes a real impact – more momentum & background below. This remote retreat will be co-designed & led with Liz Neeley of Liminal, a hero-expert in science communication and sensemaking and who has been getting to know you and your work over the past months.\nRetreat Details - Oct 16-17 2024, 10am-2pm PT each day (remotely, online). We see the main value of this retreat as a chance to reconnect and ​​reinvigorate our cross-DAAC community going into fall. We will hear from many voices to share progress and barriers to support users, and onboard more of our growing community as contributors as we refine our shared vision for momentum forward. We will follow up with report-out summaries and ways to contribute for mentors not able to join.\nMomentum - NASA Openscapes Mentors have created “go-to” resources for staff and users across DAACs – such as the earthaccess python library and tutorials in the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook. Over the last 3.5 years, mentors have developed a supportive community and created these resources in response to teaching hundreds of DAAC users via workshops and events together, and then further iterated through active use, documentation, and teaching. Recent presentations showcasing this work is Supporting NASA Earthdata users in the Cloud: NASA Openscapes onboarding & fledging and earthaccess: how to accelerate user value through open, collaborative development; all work is developed openly and linked from https://nasa-openscapes.github.io. \nBackground - Openscapes is an open source approach and a movement. It is a way to work together that shifts culture by helping people find each other and collaboratively evolve their work with modern and kind open data science workflows. Openscapes launched in 2018 through funding from Mozilla, via an open science fellowship awarded to Julia Lowndes. Openscapes grew with funding from NASA Earthdata, via decades-long community building leadership by Erin Robinson. In addition to our flagship Champions program that helps science teams shift workflows to open science, we lead multi-year projects with NASA and NOAA. Our NASA work supports scientific researchers using data from NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud; our NOAA work is part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act funds to support NOAA Fisheries’ data, infrastructure, and workforce modernization."

Through the NASA Openscapes community, we support researchers using NASA Earthdata as they migrate their data analysis workflows to the Cloud. This Fall, Openscapes is partnering with Coiled to support us experimenting with another approach to Cloud access.\nAmy Steiker, Luis Lopez, and Andy Barrett from NSIDC and Aronne Merrelli from the University of Michigan shared their scientific use cases which motivated this post.\nWe show how to run existing NASA data workflows on the cloud, in parallel, with minimal code changes using Coiled. We also discuss cost optimization.\nPeople often run the same function over many files in cloud storage. This looks something like the following:\nThis straightforward but important pattern occurs frequently in groups working with NASA Earthdata and NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) to move scientific workloads to the cloud. Here are some examples:\nIn this post we’ll show how to run this same “function on many files” analysis pattern on the cloud with Coiled, which you can copy and modify for your own use case. We’ll also highlight cost optimization strategies for processing terabyte-scale data for fractions of a dollar."

We have had some recent big inflection points.\nOpenscapes is going to the White House! Openscapes is being recognized at the “Celebration of the OSTP Year of Open Science Recognition Challenge Winners” on September 19. This is a BIG DEAL and we are excited to share the joy with our community. Our September 26 Community Call debriefing The White House trip – which also includes presenting at the Dynamic Convergence Workshop - will continue the celebration as Ileana Fenwick and Julie Lowndes interview each other about their experiences. Please sign up here!\nNOAA Fisheries announced a 3-year commitment to open science as part of the Biden-Harris Administration Inflation Reduction Act. Openscapes is thrilled to be part of this work. We have been scaffolding with NOAA Fisheries for the past few years – through 10 Champions Cohorts and developing a cross-agency grassroots mentor community (read next paragraph about a recent publication!). This is such a celebration for the open science community as a whole, a high-profile example of what open science can look like in the government. It means open science directly helping meet the needs of changing oceans by supporting the NOAA workforce focused on climate resilience for fishing communities. It is also a huge celebration for NASA, whom NOAA has been watching and inspired by for their efforts in open science.\nRead our peer-reviewed paper co-authored by Openscapes mentors across organizations – including NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, U.S. EPA, California Water Boards, Pathways to Open Science, and the Fred Hutch Cancer Center - recently published in Ecology & Evolution. From co-author Anna Holder, Cal EPA / Water Boards: “It’s a short read and quite uplifting and inspirational and provides some more insight and what we’re learning as we implement Openscapes across organizations.” https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11341; Blog post\nOpenscapes update from Julie Lowndes, summer 2024 is another big deal. Julie talks about and codifies the Opencapes ethos, the organization’s structure, shares updates on new core team members Liz Neeley and Andy Teucher, how we all work together, and how we are igniting real culture change across science.\n2023 marked 5 years of Openscapes! We’ve been reflecting on our momentum and impact, and invite you to share what stands out to you in our Openscapes Survey. We’ve been sharing insights via talks and our submission to the Challenge.gov (the catalyst for The White House visit). We plan to share more at a submitted talk at the AGU Fall Meeting in Washington DC in December."

We are just wrapping up Year 1 and amazed at how much we have collectively accomplished this year with the DAAC mentors and participating DAACs as well as all the researchers and research teams we have worked with. You can read more about our first year in our 2021 annual report. \nAs part of this work, with the DAAC mentors, we co-led our first NASA Openscapes Champions cohort. Based on Openscapes’ flagship program, Openscapes Champions, theNASA Openscapes Champions Cohort was a professional development and mentorship opportunity for early adopter, science teams that use NASA Earthdata and were interested in migrating their existing workflows to the cloud through collaborative open data science practices. The Openscapes Champions Cohort ran formally in March - April 2022. \nThe ten research teams who participated were interested in a wide variety of NASA Earthdata and various stages of cloud technology familiarity. You can learn more about their research below. Together as a Champions cohort they discussed what worked and didn’t work as they migrated workflows to the cloud, with a focus on collaboration and open science. We met as a cohort five times over two months, on alternating Fridays. Each cohort call included a welcome and code of conduct reminder, two teaching sessions with time for reflection in small groups or silent journaling and group discussion, before closing with suggestions for future team meeting topics (“Seaside Chats”), Efficiency Tips, and Tips. Additional hands-on clinics and coworking sessions were scheduled within this period and will extend for the next two months to support these teams as they continue to work on the cloud workflow migration. In addition, the teams were supported by the Openscapes DAAC mentors and staff and Element84 and had access to Openscapes’ 2i2c Jupyter Hub, which will continue for the next year.\n\n\n\nZoomie class photo of NASA Champions"

    "text": "What did participants achieve?\nJust like our DAAC mentors have built collaborative bridges across the distributed data centers to identify the common parts of cloud data access over the first year of our project, this cohort was an opportunity to connect NASA Earthdata users, building a community that is eager to use data in the cloud and provides a forum to discuss common techniques and challenges. The teams devoted at least 8 hours a month to focus on their workflows. In this time, they thought through and discussed their current NASA Earthdata workflows and planned and experimented with transitioning their workflows to the cloud using Openscapes’ 2i2c-hosted Jupyter Hub as a first step. As in other Openscapes Champions cohorts, teams also realized the power of onboarding to create more resilient labs and they explored creating collaborative spaces for their teams through Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub. \nThemes we revisited throughout the cohort included: \nThe Open science underpinnings of the Openscapes Champions program are important. During our last Champions session when the teams presented their pathways, it was amazing to hear how many times that teams were trying to use Github, Gitlab, or taking away other Open science practices in addition to the cloud-specific. It wasn’t all or nothing, they were taking small steps. It was also great to hear that a takeaway from this cohort is, working more openly and reproducibly provides for a more resilient workflow and team. \nWe intentionally focus on providing a kind welcome to technical topics. The kind space that we co-created with the teams and DAAC mentors provided an opportunity to collaborate as teams and ask questions that may in other settings go unasked because of fear that everyone else already knows. (Note: everyone else doesn’t know and will be glad you asked!)   \nThis also led to several challenges that consistently surfaced and still need more focused effort to resolve. The vocabulary to understand the Cloud needs to be clearly explained. For example, what is an S3 bucket or a “requester pays bucket” and why does a user need to know about AWS West-2? Cloud cost is another challenge. We lower the barrier by providing the 2i2c Jupyterhub, but teams don’t want to depend on our hub. They want their own workspace and want to be able to predict costs more effectively. Finally, our work has been focused on Python because that was the language of choice for DAAC mentors and it is a widely used open-source language in the broader Earth science community. In the Champions Cohort we had three teams using Matlab and one team using R; we need to think about how to expand our support and tutorial materials for these other languages."

We are moving from the structured sessions of the Champions program into two additional months of coworking time and 1-1 interactions with DAAC mentors and staff and Element84 in order to make lasting changes with cloud data access. \nWe will focus on specific topics like: \n\nPracticing GitHub workflows and teaching others on your team \nCloud spatial subsetting \nEnvironment management for creating cloud computing space that is reproducible and scalable (e.g. docker images) \nDask/Pangeo software stack to enable scalable processing \nCloud costs and setup \nNetCDF to Zarr\nDocker containers \n\nFinally, we are grateful to this Champion Cohort’s early adopter spirit, their time and effort to make this migration, and all of the feedback and input they provided. They all participated in this cohort knowing that they were some of the first research teams to use NASA Earthdata in the cloud and that they were the first NASA Openscapes Champions cohort. This meant that there would be technical challenges as we work out migrating to the cloud, yet what they learn will make it easier for subsequent teams making this same shift. It also exhibited the reciprocal learning that happens; we will refine the NASA Openscapes Champions as we plan for our next cohort and our work with the DAAC mentors in year 2."

    "text": "NASA Openscapes Champions Teams\nThe Cryosphere Geophysics and Remote Sensing (CryoGARS) Glaciology Team at Boise State University analyzes modern changes to the Earth’s cryosphere, with a focus on rapid changes in glacier flow, glacier-ocean interactions, iceberg melting, and seasonal snow accumulation and melt. Nearly all of our projects use Landsat imagery to map changes in glacier, iceberg, and/or snow extent. Several projects also use Landsat data to map glacier velocities or rely on NASA-produced glacier velocities computed from Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. We also use ICESat-2 data to map glacier volume change and seasonal snow in mountain regions. We look forward to using more cloud resources so that we can expand our analyses in space and time in order to advance our understanding of Cryosphere change!\nThe Mapes Team at the University of Miami studies atmospheric dynamics through multi-source data synthesis, with global grids as the glue. The global grids are huge, so downloading is out of the question. Fetching from aggregations (THREDDS, GDS) works for case studies, but sometimes we need to process it all (simplest example: make a multi-year climatology, to give context to actual fields as “anomalies”). So the data lake in the cloud will be a nice resource, and open new vistas like machine learning which always benefits from more data.\nThe Cornillon Team at the University of Rhode Island has several projects making use of MODIS and VIIRS sea surface temperature (SST). The project of focus for this cohort has been the statistical description of the location, strength, and temporal evolution of SST fronts. As part of this project, we developed an algorithm to unmask pixels improperly flagged as cloud contaminated in the standard MODIS SST products. The improved masks will be made available to the community at large as will the fronts identified by our edge detection algorithm. \nThe LoL Team has members from USGS, UCSB, and the University of Arizona. Kate uses dense time series of Landsat data to build harmonic models to predict land use cover and land use change and its links to climatological signals. Crista and Sarah research the human dimensions of earth observation data, such as Landsat. Nikki uses NASA drought models to map climate hazards in her Navajo Nation community. The research project “Power of the Pixel: Connecting Communities through Remote Sensing in the United States” combines the power of all three foci to use NASA/USGS Landsat data to build earth observation capacity in communities across the United States.\nThe SASSIE Team has members from the University of Washington, JPL, and APL. They are part of the NASA salinity and SWOT science teams, and regularly use satellite salinity, temperature, altimetry and sea ice data, as well as in situ holdings (SPURS-2, upcoming SASSIE experiment).\nThe Tandon Team at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth uses remotely sensed data to setup the larger scale perspectives for our more in depth analysis and cruise based work for in-situ experimental data from initiatives in the Indian Ocean such as ASIRI and MISOBOB.\nThe Palter Team at the University of Rhode Island uses NASA data to compare with in-situ observations taken from ships and Uncrewed Surface Vehicles. NASA data provides additional parameters (like ocean surface topography) that are useful in the understanding of in-situ data (for example identifying fronts in the ACC). We have also used ocean color data from MODIS-Aqua to map distributions of ocean surface properties, such as chlorophyll concentration & sea surface salinity (region-specific algorithm), to analyze seasonal, annual, and decadal trends of key biogeochemical processes in the ocean.\nThe Just Team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai uses earth observations to reconstruct ground-level environmental exposures to fine particulate matter, air temperature, and humidity which we use in epidemiologic health studies with cohorts and large registries in the US and Mexico. In a project that started out by seeking to understand the pattern of error in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrievals, we have developed an R-based reproducible workflow using the targets package for collocating and correcting AOD from the MAIAC algorithm (product MCD19A2 for Aqua and Terra) versus ground stations using gradient-boosted machine learning. This workflow adds reproducibility and extensibility for further development and new applications, building on results we have published for AOD (https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10050803) and for column water vapor (https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4669-2020; data/code in Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.3568449).\nThe Hain/SPoRT Team is a directly funded NASA activity and engages with operational stakeholders to transition unique NASA observations and capabilities to improve decision-making.\nThe Roberts Team supports evaluation of global energy and water budgets, develops retrieval algorithms and climate data records (e.g. SeaFlux V1), evaluates air-sea interaction and ocean winds, and downscales and bias corrects models for use in hydrologic and agricultural modeling)."

    "text": "Welcome to Openscapes’ twelfth newsletter! If you’re interested in seeing these infrequent updates in your inbox, please sign up here (linked from our connect with us page).\nCross-posted at openscapes.org/blog, nmfs-openscapes.github.io/blog, nasa-openscapes.github.io/news, openscapes.github.io/pathways-to-open-science/blog.\nHello all,\nIt is a new year, 2026. We are back from the holidays and already feeling the sense of togetherness and not aloneness as we get back to work. We feel this through the shared effort of many groups supporting science, supporting open practices, supporting each other. There are many ways to get this right. We are grateful to be a part of your community and this huge effort supporting science. Openscapes is here, funded, strong and resolved, and providing stability and community for people in their daily work.\nWe spent 2025 building and iterating with our collaborators. Many of our shared accomplishments are listed in this newsletter’s blog post. We tested systems we have developed, and met the moment by “forking” these systems to respond to changing needs with little turnaround time. As we shared in Julie’s Greg Leptoukh Lecture Award “Forking as a worldview” talk at the December 2025 AGU Fall Meeting – co-authored as our core team – this mindset and practice of “forking” enables us to be responsive and impactful, weathering uncertainty and looking out for each other. For example, “forking” enabled us to support NASA Earthdata users and NOAA Fisheries staff this fall, despite the disruptive government shutdown. We supported them through the NASA Openscapes Champions (Nov 13-14) and earthaccess Hackday on Dec 15 (online and in New Orleans); and leading 3x NOAA Fisheries Champions Cohorts Nov 18-Jan 21 (online; original dates Oct 7-Dec 11 shifted due to the shutdown).\nIn 2026 we’re continuing to support our current partners as we expand our collaborations with new partners. We will be leading a Champions Cohort with the European Space Agency’s EarthCODE project – our first international cohort! This is also part of the sustainability and business infrastructure building in the past year that we shared a bit about in Julie’s Leptoukh lecture.\nWe have upcoming blog posts in the works detailing the items in bold above.\nWe are currently planning events for 2026 – later than normal since we have just finished the 3 NOAA Fisheries Champions Cohorts that were delayed 5 weeks with the shutdown. Needing to “slow down to speed up”, we have made the difficult decision to pause our annual Pathways to Open Science and Reflections Programs this year. We appreciate our partners in cultivating the Pathways to Open Science community these past three years! We are also focused on “showing up at other people’s parties” and learning in solidarity with other open communities, as well as leading events with partners. Please check our events page for upcoming 2026 events, including community calls, cohorts, and conference talks, as they are planned.\nWhen things are hard, we shift to create and empower mode. And we do this together. It can feel overwhelming and not enough at the same time. But we are creating our own certainty where we can, and it matters. Openscapes team member and Liminal founder, Liz Neeley, writes Meeting the Moment, a weekly digest to help us keep current—but avoid feeling flooded—by staying focused.\nWe appreciate what you are all doing."

    "text": "Easy Scalable Cloud Computing with Coiled\nThe call started with a few demos, first from Andy Barrett and Amy Steiker from NSIDC. Andy shared a science use case based on translating photons measurements from ICESAT-2 to sea ice thickness. These data were first accessed with the earthaccess Python library, then needed to be regridded over geographic areas, which Amy demoed in this Jupyter notebook. Amy ran this code on her laptop and used Coiled to spin up remote virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud to run her computations.\n\n\n\nThen, James ran through two common workflows that process terabyte-scale cloud datasets. In the first example, we saw how to churn through many cloud-hosted NASA Earthdata files (~500 GB of NetCDF files) in parallel on the cloud. This involved lightly decorating an existing Python function with the Coiled Function decorator. The entire workflow ran in &lt;10 minutes and cost ~$0.36.\nIn the next example, we used Xarray to process 6 TB of the cloud-hosted NOAA water model where we computed the average water table depth for each county in the US for the year 2020. We parallelized and distributed the work across 50 VMs using a Coiled cluster. The workflow ran in &lt; 5 minutes and cost ~$1.\n\n\n\nLuis commented on how cloud computing is a barrier for many teams, but tools like Coiled provide options for working in the cloud easily. In fact, Coiled is just half the magic (provisioning cloud resources); the rest is the open source packages, which together help science move faster."

Bri set the stage with our motivation. People working across 11 NASA data centers (DAACs) need a way to see a year’s worth of “who’s here; what are we doing; when are we doing it; where can we find overlap with each other?” The work requires advance planning, and we’d love to avoid having everyone need to separately look up the registration deadlines for conferences. That can all be on a community calendar. We need a solution that is lightweight, with a low barrier to entry, and agnostic to specific calendaring software like Google Calendar vs Microsoft Outlook."

    "text": "How we’re using GitHub for calendaring and management\n\n\n“I’ve been waiting for something like this for… probably a year” - Bri Lind, NASA Land Processes data center.\n\n\nFor the past three years, we have been using GitHub as a community to collaborate around code, tutorials, and documentation, taking advantage of its features for version control, code review, and workshop book publishing. This is important not only because it helps us develop collaboratively as a team, but it’s also the same technology that Earth science researchers use, so we are able to develop practical experience to help them every day as we work. It made sense to explore using GitHub more deeply for our planning and calendaring. \nWe started using GitHub as a centralized place where any of the ~40 NASA Openscapes Mentors can post dates and information for a conference workshop they are leading, for example. Everyone else can see it, and someone might comment “I’m speaking at the same conference. I can give some hands-on help.”, or “Here’s a python notebook I created for a similar workshop last month.” During the Community Call, Stef screenshared our MainPlanning GitHub Project, the Roadmap view (screenshot below) that gives a calendar perspective and the Table view for details on each item. She demo’d creating a GitHub Issue, associating it with the Project, adding topic labels, and a Start date to have it appear in the Roadmap. She showed how we’re also documenting this as we go with screenshots in NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook - GitHub for Calendaring and Project Management.\n\n\n\nRoadmap view of a GitHub Project for NASA Openscapes Mentors and collaborators"

Many teams were interested in using data from multiple DAACs. User cloud adaption takes time, given the new conceptual mindsets and technical skillsets it requires.

It is encouraging to hear some of the champions starting to have conversations with their institutions, IT departments, and making their needs known, which is likely a big part of the solution, too. We are thankful to NASA Openscapes Champions for informing and nudging these conversations!

    "section": "NASA Champions Cohort Overview",
    "text": "NASA Champions Cohort Overview\nNASA Openscapes is a multi-year project to develop a cohesive approach to building cloud migration capacity across NASA Earthdata from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) and the research teams supported by the DAACs. We do this through supporting a community of NASA DAAC mentors, who are primarily dedicated to user support. This community has learned together how to use NASA Earthdata in the Cloud. They have translated that experience into a series of hackathons, workshops, self-paced tutorial material in the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, and through an intensive, 10-week NASA Openscapes Champions program.\nUser cloud adaption can often have a steep learning curve and feel overwhelming. The NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort brings together research teams that are interested in migrating their existing NASA Earthdata workflows to the Cloud with NASA DAAC Mentors who are extremely knowledgeable about the data they serve and the initial pathways to using that data in the Cloud. This Cohort provides a common, welcoming place for teams to learn together, ask questions about using the Cloud, plan their transition, and do initial experimentation using the NASA Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub. Because this is a more intensive experience, the teams build collaborative partnerships with DAAC mentors, and the mentors can more quickly identify and work on solving issues that will make cloud migration easier for many more users. We led the first NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort in 2022.\nThe third NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort ran during April-May 2024 with nine research teams interested in a wide variety of NASA Earthdata and various stages of cloud technology familiarity. You can learn more about their research below.\n\n\n\nVideo conference screen shot (♥) of some researchers in the 2024 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort.\n\n\nTogether as a Champions Cohort, these teams discussed what worked and didn’t work as they migrated workflows to the Cloud, focusing on collaboration and Open Science. We met as a cohort five times over two months on alternating Wednesdays. Each cohort call included a welcome and code of conduct reminder and two teaching sessions with time for reflection in small groups or silent journaling and group discussion before closing with suggestions for future team meeting topics (“Seaside Chats”), Efficiency Tips, and Tips. All topics and the slides presented are shared on the 2024 Cohort page. Additional coworking sessions were scheduled on alternate weeks, where researchers could work quietly, screenshare to ask questions, or meet with their team to discuss further. In addition, the teams have access to Openscapes’ 2i2c Jupyter Hub, which will continue for the next year. \nThe NASA Openscapes Mentors supported the Champions and contributed to the curriculum (all available at https://openscapes.github.io/series). In particular, the NASA Openscapes Champions Curriculum had important additions. \n\nAronne Merrelli (University of Michigan, 2023 Champion) shared his experiences of First Forays into the Cloud, and how it’s possible to go from cloud novice to feeling like it’s a superpower and doing real analyses for his American Geophysical Union (AGU) poster (and beyond!). YouTube clip \nCatalina Taglialatela (PO.DAAC) led the Earthdata Cloud Clinic with datasets from several DAACs and using the earthaccess Python library for NASA Earthdata search & access in the Cloud. \nMatt Fisher (NSIDC) updated psychological safety examples - this lesson particularly resonated with the Champions teams who reflected together about how this is important for learning new things. YouTube clip.\nAlexis Hunzinger (GES DISC) extended the Data strategies in the Cloud lesson with considerations of environmental impact /climate change and streaming data in the same way you stream video on a streaming service such as Netflix, without downloading to a local computer or server.\nCassie Nickles (PO.DAAC) walked through and welcomed contributions to NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, a learning-oriented resources hub to support scientific researchers who use NASA Earthdata as NASA migrates data and workflows to the cloud.- YouTube clip.\nBrianna Lind (LP DAAC, KBR Inc., under contract to the U.S. Geological Survey)’s Open Communities lesson solicited many additional examples including Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), US Research Software Engineering (US-RSE), Research Data Alliance (RDA), Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP), CryoCloud, Project Pythia.\nMahsa Jami (LP DAAC, KBR Inc., under contract to the U.S. Geological Survey) shared coding strategies for parallelizing code and dove into parallel processing from a scientist perspective. “Pleasingly parallel” is a term for tasks that are completely independent from each other - for example, to validate whether each value in a dataset is within a threshold. YouTube clip.\nLuis Lopez (NSIDC) demonstrated new interactive features of the earthaccess Python library: earthaccess.explore()which provides interactivity without having to download data. This feature only streams metadata (of the dataset’s spatial coverage, volume size) and not the data itself. earthaccess.explore() enables previewing the data and helps narrow down what you may eventually want to stream to memory or download. Additional features enable you to identify different satellite swath overlaps in a selected area and save egress costs because it works more efficiently. YouTube clip.\nAndy Teucher demoed data storage strategies in the Cloud, first via a notebook tutorial about How to store data in the Cloud (including where to store and how to delete your intermediate & test files) and then about storage strategies & costs. YouTube clip.\n\n\n\n\nLuis López demonstrates new interactive features of the earthaccess Python library that enable users to identify different satellite swath overlaps in a selected area.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure by Andy Teucher showing costs of compute (purple) and storage (blue and green) in the Cloud.

    "section": "What we learned and challenges",
    "text": "What we learned and challenges\nThe Openscapes Champions provides a space for teams to come together to learn from each other and across teams. It is a way to collaborate and distribute leadership roles across the various teams, helping to reduce the burden team leaders often feel of needing to learn everything first before teaching it to the rest of the team. \nHere are the highlights of the third Champions Cohort:\n\nScience teams were using data across DAACs - more this year than ever! It felt great to demonstrate the same earthaccess workflows with datasets from different DAACs.\nEveryone had less capacity to engage this year - both from the Mentors’ side and Champions side. We saw less activity between sessions on Slack and in Coworking. This could in part be video conferencing fatigue, but also might highlight the benefit of people (Mentors + Champions) having additional time outside of the normal five calls to experiment, ask questions, and develop. This kind of engagement has led to useful development in the past (refer to next bullet).\nPast Champions Cohorts have resulted in useful developments, including the earthaccess Python library and MATLAB integration in the Hub. This year, emerging development is around “how to talk to your institution’s IT about your cloud needs” and NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) data access. More to come!\nWe had a lot of “new” content added from what we learned in the last year (Hub storage in S3 buckets, computing concepts, psychological safety!). This meant that we spent less time on core open science skills & practices that we do in the Core Champions Lesson Series (https://openscapes.github.io/series). These core open science skills & practices can help people feel confident and willing to share needs.\nFeedback from participants was valuable:\n\n“Openscapes has allowed me to see that working in Python and in the Cloud is not as scary as I once thought it was. I hope to collaborate more with others that are already using cloud computing so I can get my feet wet in some publishable research using S3 buckets. Where before I would not have thought that I could be a viable contributor.”\n“I used to think that cloud computing was for parallelizing processes and when you needed a really fast computer. I never thought about its ability to store data in a format that is easily accessed for VERY large data sets. I wish that more people in fisheries would start thinking about how their data could be stored in multidimensional arrays rather than flat data frames.”\n“Many people have great ideas but facilitators often have to work to get those ideas out into the open and the same method of getting those ideas out will NOT work on everyone. So, if you care about progress you should care about using multiple avenues to allow people to express themselves.”\n\n\nSeveral challenges working with NASA Earthdata in the Cloud are still unresolved, many which apply more broadly than just NASA data and rather to user adoption of the cloud computing technology in general. These include: \n\nWhile Aronne Merrelli’s story was inspiring, Champions reflected that they find it hard to think about projects that would be good for the Cloud when they have no experience using the Cloud – so how can you find a project to move to the Cloud when your brain won’t let you go there in the first place?\nCost - we still need to have and communicate a better sense of this. We intentionally do not have the “how much does it cost” conversation early on because our intention is to help people experience what it involves and first think about “when to cloud.” However, we do have cost numbers from previous years and plan to gather more cost statistics for the upcoming ESIP summer meeting.\nWe need to think about storage differently in the Cloud because users pay daily to store data in the Cloud. Champions commented that they often “over-produce” files because storage is cheap and access is easy on local machines. How do we learn what is really important and what we can “toss”?\nFolks had interest in learning more about working with confidential data in the Cloud, as researchers often combine non-NASA data for their analyses and this is expected to be an increasing need.\nSeveral themes/questions recurred that we have heard before and for which remain as open questions. Importantly, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud onboarding, when to use what resources, how to set them up, and how to discuss needs with organizational leadership and IT staff, often falls outside the scope of NASA DAACs, yet it’s a key element of helping users adopt the Cloud and use NASA data in the Cloud. It is encouraging to hear some of the champions starting to have conversations with their institutions, IT departments, and making their needs known, which is likely a big part of the solution, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure by Alexis Hunzinger showing the focus of cloud for data storage and compute.

    "section": "Team Pathways and Cloud Momentum",
    "text": "Team Pathways and Cloud Momentum\nPart of the Openscapes Champions approach is that teams decide what to work on. The teams devoted at least 8 hours a month to focus on their workflows, learning, and collaborating within and across their teams. During this time, they thought through and discussed their current NASA Earthdata workflows and planned and experimented with transitioning their workflows to the Cloud using Openscapes’ 2i2c-hosted Jupyter Hub as a first step. As in other Openscapes Champions cohorts, teams also realized the power of Open Science and that open is a spectrum that includes considering future us - potentially just you or your group in 3 months. \n“Fledging” was a big theme this year, especially following Aronne Merrelli’s talk. We think of this as where do researchers go to do their real science, when they leave the Openscapes 2i2c Hub for experimental purposes? What do they need to know in terms of cost estimates, docker images, administrative personnel (potentially both technical and policy)? We saw teams and the NASA DAAC mentors make substantial progress in migrating workflows to the Cloud. A few highlights from teams that participated in the cohort included:\n\n\nThe Ocean Science Analytics team experimented with and found ‎earthaccess to be insightful and useful! This was valuable as a hands-on activity. The team members have questions about setting up AWS on their own and would like to understand what tools are needed for a specific task. For example, when could dask, an open-source Python library for parallel computing, be used for a task or would another tool be more appropriate?\nThe NOAA IEA (Integrated Ecosystem Assessment) team benefitted from having an improved conceptual understanding of what is involved with cloud workflows – they would like to work with NOAA IT to understand what’s available and possible with JupyterHubs and find workable solutions, now that we understand more of the possibilities.\nThe PACE Hackweek team found Hubs ‎very instrumental in learning cloud computing and helping to create hackweek tutorials. They have used their seaside chats for tutorial development, using GitHub, and have included people outside their team. They have gained more understanding about AWS EC2/storage service by having conversations with Science Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE) for gaining access to Open Science Studio (OSS).\nThe NOAA Coastwatch team took what they learned from the Earthdata Cloud Clinic and reused it to teach 70 colleagues from across NOAA at the NOAA Enterprise Data Management Workshop in their EDMW-EarthData-Workshop-2024. They taught the same tutorials twice, first in Python using earthaccess and then in R using earthdatalogin.\nThe Wimberly Lab Team shared their pathway with a bridge metaphor and how they are tackling challenges through talking about this in lab meetings and learning new tools together. \nAsynchronously, Lucas Barbedo from the Liu-Zhang team shared about using NASA PACE data [comment + thread] in the 2i2c JupyterHub following the Earthdata Cloud Clinic, and shared progress through a GitHub discussion: What’s happening on the NASA Openscapes Hub!? . \n\n\n\n\nFigure by Wimberly Lab (Yusuf Jamal) showing the teams’ pathway with a bridge metaphor. \n\n\nAdditional Cloud resources shared from the NOAA Enterprise Data Management Workshop\n\nhttps://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/\nhttps://abarciauskas-bgse.github.io/presentations/noaa-edmw-intro-2024‎\nhttps://projectpythia.org/dask-cookbook/"

    "text": "Onward!\nIf the 2024 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort is any indication, the NASA Earthdata community is making substantial strides in building capacity to use cloud resources, and the transition is successfully happening. Although the cohort is officially over, these teams are just at their beginning, and we are excited to follow their results as they experiment with parallelizing code and incorporating storage considerations in their workflows. We plan to continue to work with them in the next year, as their 2i2c managed cloud Hub access continues. As we did last year, we are planning to offer the Carpentries Instructor Training for interested Champions this summer. The Carpentries is a nonprofit that teaches introductory coding skills around the world. Instructor Training is not coding-specific, but it is an educational approach to teaching technical topics. As part of our NASA grant, we have partnered with The Carpentries and are excited to extend this opportunity to Champions because many of them mentioned wanting to contribute more to open science efforts going forward.\nWe are grateful to this Champion Cohort for their early adopter spirit, their time and effort to make this migration, and all the feedback and input they provided. They all participated in this cohort, knowing that while this was the third Cohort, they were among the first research teams to use NASA Earthdata in the Cloud. What they learned and shared will make it easier for subsequent teams to make this same shift. Many teams articulated this spirit of open leadership, explicitly asking how they could help other teams. We also learned so much from this cohort, which will help us refine the NASA Openscapes Champions program, as we plan for our next cohort and our work with the DAAC mentors in the future years of our project."

    "section": "About the NASA Openscapes Champions Teams",
    "text": "About the NASA Openscapes Champions Teams\nThe Liu-Zhang (University of Louisiana at Lafayette & University of Southern Mississippi) team primarily uses NASA Earthdata Search to access datasets from Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) and The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) missions, which we then use to create algorithms for ecosystem analysis. We have a particular interest in using hyperspectral data, such as the upcoming PACE data to study vegetation and algae in water bodies. Our work involves developing deep learning models for habitat classification and analyzing water quality. Transitioning to hyperspectral imaging and deep learning greatly increases computational demands, making it challenging to execute code locally compared to leveraging cloud computing resources. Additionally, this transition enhances the accessibility of our algorithm to the public. Currently funded by EMIT and serving as early adopters of PACE, we are eager to contribute to the NASA Cookbook by offering new algorithms that apply to NASA’s latest satellite data, such as EMIT and PACE.\nThe Ocean Science Analytics team incorporates NASA data in our studies of coastal and offshore marine regions, specifically as it pertains to marine mammals. Combining in situ data from hydrophones to determine the vocal occurrence of marine mammals with remotely sensed ocean color data, we use chlorophyll, net primary productivity, sea surface temperature, etc. to characterize the associated habitat and document changes over time. As a PACE early adopter, we are incorporating PACE data in our studies through large scale observations of photosynthesizing organisms, which will allow us to incorporate direct measurements of the presence and distributions of plankton species. This in connection with feeding behavior will provide a better understanding of the spatial use of these habitats.\nThe PACE Hackweek team supports the NASA PACE mission, which launched in February 2024 and is collecting unprecedented data from our global oceans, atmosphere, and land. PACE data will be hosted in the Cloud; therefore, we are interested in learning more about cloud-based workflows to access and analyze PACE data and contribute our efforts and outcomes to our community of end-users.\nThe NOAA CoastWatch team is motivated by how rising ocean temperatures, higher sea levels, melting ice, and increasing ocean acidity are changing the way marine life and ecosystems function in our world’s oceans. This affects everything from how we manage fisheries and protect communities that depend on fishing to how we protect important habitats and species. The ocean is expected to continue changing and changes are expected to become more extreme. A lot is at stake. Improving how we use Earth data in our workflows is essential. We have much we can learn about migrating to the Cloud by connecting with other earth science teams at NASA and with the NASA Openscapes mentors.\nThe Wimberly Lab (University of Oklahoma) team explores the impacts of changing climate and landscapes on ecosystems and human health, with an emphasis on developing spatial decision support tools to support public health decisions, land use planning, and natural resource management. We address these topics through landscape, regional, and global analyses using satellite remote sensing and other sources of environmental monitoring data. Specific research areas include the effects of environmental change on vector-borne disease outbreaks, the influences of human land use and wildfires on forest landscape dynamics, the impacts of agricultural expansion and intensification on native ecosystems, and the development of computer software for disease outbreak forecasting and landscape change modeling. We conduct our research in locations throughout the world including North America, West Africa, Ethiopia, and India.\nThe NOAA IEA team’s approach provides cross-disciplinary science to support ecosystem-based management in the Gulf of Mexico. For example, we conduct research on climate-fisheries interactions, changes in species ranges and distributions, and environmental impacts on fisheries such as those driven by harmful algal blooms. We use data from earth system modeling and remotely sensed data, including sea surface temperature, sea surface height, ocean currents, wind, ocean color, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and primary production indices. We are particularly interested in integrating modern open-science techniques to automate our core deliverables, called Ecosystem Status Reports, and other data products related to NOAA surveys. We’re beginning to test some of these approaches in ongoing projects. For example, the ongoing IEA-Wind project aims to develop data baselines to track the impacts of forthcoming offshore wind energy infrastructure development. The project has been conceptualized and executed thus far with an open-data approach. We believe that a deeper understanding of the concepts and approaches offered by this Cohort would allow for a more holistic application across Gulf of Mexico IEA efforts. \nThe NASA SERVIR Central America team are representatives of Costa Rica’s National System of Conservation Areas (SINAC, in Spanish), the Forest Research and Services Institute of the National University of Costa Rica, and the Central America Aerospace Network (RAC, in Spanish). The NASA / USAID SERVIR program is helping to connect the Costa Rican researchers with Openscapes. The team is responsible for generating Costa Rica’s official national forest cover maps, in the context of its national forest monitoring system. Therefore, involving the team will have a notable national impact in terms of their reporting to international commitments (e.g., the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 15.2). The team is currently using Google Earth Engine (GEE) to access and process data from Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical). They combine these datasets and perform a supervised classification to generate land cover maps. While the team’s workflow is already in the Cloud (via GEE), they are interested in exploring additional computational capabilities that may be available via AWS for processing big data, including the inclusion of other datasets like that of the Landsat archive.\nThe POSTECH (University South Korea) team is actively engaged in climate modeling research, utilizing both Python and NCAR Command Language (NCL) scripts to analyze climate data. We are eager to expand our knowledge and skills by collaborating with experts in the field, and we are keen to explore new methodologies and insights. Joining your team presents an exciting opportunity for us to enhance our expertise and broaden our exposure to cutting-edge techniques in climate science.\nDisclaimer: Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.\nReference herein to any specific commercial product, process, or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply its endorsement by the United States Government or the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology."

We also share the lessons and challenges learned from this case study. By the way, this talk IS for cloud novices, NOT for cloud gurus.\n\n\n\nTitle slide from the presentation by Pan et al.\n\n\nThis presentation aims to inform and educate the NASA user community on cloud data and cloud computing. They shared the pathways, benefits, and roadblocks to cloud computing using an interdisciplinary case study and live demos of various cloud-accessing scenarios done in a JupyterHub that is part of the NASA Openscapes project managed by 2i2c.\n\n\n\nOutline of the presentation by Pan et al.\n\n\nXiaohua also shared her journal from a scientist doing her research with all on-premises data to a pathfinder conducting her wildfire research in the cloud to shed some light on others to find their journeys to the cloud. Finally, she emphasized the importance of cloud training gained through openscapes as a DAAC staff. This presentation reached about 70 people from NASA earth science divisions and universities. It was well received, with many questions and positive feedback, reflecting the interest and puzzlement of the NASA user community on cloud data and cloud computing.\n\n\n\nInterdisciplinary case study of characterizing wildfires in the western US, from the presentation by Pan et al.\n\n\nXiaohua Pan:\nDr. Pan joined Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) at NASA GSFC in 2020 as a senior scientific software developer, working on data services including curating NASA’s earth data (e.g., MERRA-2) and user support.

The communities below include people within our partner organizations that work together to deliver work aligned with their goals to enable science and society, and are enriched by collaborating with the open science community.\n\nNASA Earthdata\n\nVision: NASA Earthdata’s vision is to make NASA’s free and open Earth science data interactive, interoperable, and accessible for research and societal benefit both today and tomorrow. This follows NASA Earth Science’s Vision: A thriving world, driven by trusted, actionable Earth science, and their Mission: Compelled by our planet’s rapid change, we innovate and collaborate to explore and understand the Earth system, make new discoveries, and enable solutions for the benefit of all.\nOpenscapes Update: NASA Openscapes Mentors have created “go-to” resources for staff and users using NASA Earthdata – such as the earthaccess python library and tutorials in the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook. Our 2025 focus is strengthening NASA networks between Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs), missions, training programs, and applications, aligned with SPD-41a open science, as we continue to support users through developing skills and tools. The NASA Openscapes Mentors developed this focus together during our Fall 2024 Mentors Retreat, building on the past three years of work together. We make progress through hosting regular online hackdays and coworking, where we develop tutorials, design and lead workshops, expand features of the earthaccess – a faster way to access and analyze NASA Earth data, develop open infrastructure through science environments (docker base images), cost monitoring and reporting for users, and open documentation. We are also planning the 2025 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort - we will lead this year’s Cohort in Fall 2025, giving time to iterate the program to support more science teams and users. Mentors will be leading other workshops this summer too; details will be at https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/news and we’ll share about NASA Champions via the next newsletter. \n\n\n\nNOAA Fisheries\n\nMission: NOAA Fisheries is responsible for the stewardship of the nation’s ocean resources and their habitat. We provide vital services for the nation, all backed by sound science and an ecosystem-based approach to management: productive and sustainable fisheries; safe sources of seafood; recovery and conservation of protected resources; healthy ecosystems.\nOpenscapes Update: Data and workforce modernization is happening at NOAA Fisheries – in many reinforcing ways through providing staff with the necessary skills and collaborative tools to drive changes in data and technical infrastructure. Over 2 months in fall 2024, 120 NOAA Fisheries staff from all six science centers, two regional offices and four headquarters offices tackled projects to improve or restructure data workflows via the Openscapes Champions Program. They made substantial progress on complex workflow transformation goals: Transitioning to contemporary data storage solutions; Automating large data-heavy reports with programmatic code and version control; Developing coordinated science program onboarding and operating procedures that are harmonized across NOAA Fisheries; and Prototyping cloud computing workflows for new data streams from satellites and ocean modeling. Now, the NOAA Fisheries mentor community is making progress on shared goals of data active archiving; infrastructure testing and governance; automated & templated reporting, and hosting coding & cloud training events. After sharing about GitHub governance at the ESIP winter meeting (slides; recording), mentors continue to use a GitHub Project Board to track progress, have awareness across the group, and continue growing synergies. Examples include a small group of mentors testing, troubleshooting, and documenting the new Google Workstations for Cloud computing, saving time and preventing frustration for hundreds of new users (issue); improving metadata creation for datasets and inPort, including facilitating meetings between research teams and developers (issue); creating diagrams and tables to help folks find the right infrastructure for a data project (issue); and sharing templates for manuscripts, publications, and research compendia in Quarto (issue; issue; issue; issue). This April we are launching our first NOAA Fisheries Data Academy with a cohort of 40 R beginners who will learn R for data analysis and visualization. \n\n\n\nCalifornia Water Boards\n\nMission: To preserve, enhance, and restore the quality of California’s water resources and drinking water for the protection of the environment, public health, and all beneficial uses, and to ensure proper water resource allocation and efficient use, for the benefit of present and future generations. The Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA) has operationalized their values into process (pdf). \nOpenscapes Update: OIMA is refining their strategic plan that has included upskilling staff through the Openscapes Champions Program since 2021. We are currently advising OIMA as they develop a communication strategy and a mentor community to grow the community of staff supporting open data science and amplify this work. This work is not only for research teams but also for teams who manage contracts, as we shared in a talk co-presented with OIMA staff at the California Department of Water Resources last year. \n\n\n\nFred Hutch Cancer Center \n\nMission: Fred Hutch Cancer Center unites innovative research and compassionate care to prevent and eliminate cancer and infectious disease. We’re driven by the urgency of our patients, the hope of our community and our passion for discovery to pursue scientific breakthroughs and healthier lives for every person in every community. The Hutch lists specific Values describing how “our mission is directly tied to the humanity, dignity and inherent value of each employee, patient, community member and supporter. Our commitment to learning across our differences and similarities make us stronger.”\nOpenscapes Update: Next week we kick off the second Champions Cohort in partnership with the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab (DaSL); this is our 24th Champions Cohort since 2019. Through the Champions Program we will introduce concepts, workflows and examples to help teams surface their problems and ideas so that they can solve them with accountability and support. It is a remote-by-design program, designed for folks with busy schedules to make real progress. The DaSL team will support through mentoring and being a direct link between teams’ needs and solutions at Fred Hutch. Learn about how the Fred Hutch mentors are working on solving the lonely data scientist problem, and stay tuned to hear about Champions accomplishments this spring."

    "text": "This week we joined a standing meeting with NASA DAAC and ESDIS managers (DMC-ESDIS Telecon). We had 30 minutes to present the goals for the upcoming year, and describe why the increase in roles and responsibilities for the NASA Openscapes Mentors. We were introduced by Justin Rice ESDIS Deputy Project Manager, and were thrilled to have the opportunity to reconnect with this group and share the joy of what the Mentors have done and continue to do together. This blog post outlines our talking points that we covered in the meeting. There was a lot of support for the NASA Openscapes Mentors overall, and for the earthaccess python library. Someone even showed the contributors list, highlighting that contributors came from across DAACs and the broader open science community.\nThis post is addressed to the audience of NASA DAAC and ESDIS managers.\n\n\nSupporting users transitioning to the Cloud across different timelines\nOver the last several years, NASA has been making a transition from on-prem hosted data at each of the DAACs to migrating that data to the cloud. Each of the DAACs has been on its own transition path, with some DAACs nearing (or completely) migrating like PO.DAAC, and others just starting to explore, like the CDDIS DAAC. This shift has had ripple effects on how each of the DAACs supports their users accessing NASA Earthdata in the cloud.\nFortunately, the different timelines of each DAAC mean that we can learn from each other and there are a lot of common elements that can be shared across the DAACs in this transition. That is where our project, the NASA Openscapes project, sits - supporting a community of practice for staff that are charged with helping NASA Earthdata users migrate to the cloud. We want to pause here and underline that all the work that NASA Openscapes Mentors and team do, is in support of NASA Earthdata users.\n\n\nNASA Openscapes goals\nNASA Openscapes has three primary goals set in our initial proposal, that still stand going forward.\nFirst, to develop a NASA Earthdata Mentor community of collaborative cloud data instructors, that co-create, curate, and use shared resources (“make once, use often”).\n\nFrom there, we have connected DAAC staff with similar roles across 11 DAACs and provided space for them to learn from each other, and reuse material (like the cheatsheets).\n\nSecond, to support the Mentors as they empower science teams to migrate their download-intensive data analysis workflows to the cloud to continue to do the premier science that each of you supports.\n\nTo date we’ve supported 17 Champions teams, 285 users active within last 6 months; many of these folks are DAAC staff and from your UWGs (User Working Groups). 480 users logged in ever.\nThe transition takes time, but we are starting to see some initial science success stories! (Aronne Merrelli with PI Nadia Smith - developing CLIMCLAPS data product archived at GES DISC; used the Champions program as proposal planning for NASA ROSES. Aronne developed workflows in 2i2c, learned to parallelize workflows with Coiled, and swapped to his University credit card once he had a functional workflow. Aronne will present to a 2024 Champions Cohort to show what’s possible for better science in less time.\n\nThird, to scale Cloud workshop infrastructure, so that each DAAC can leverage it easily and efficiently.\n\nOur first workshop was the Nov 2021 hackathon led by PO.DAAC and supported by NSIDC, LP DAAC and many other mentors. This hackathon helped the mentors develop the seed material for new-to-cloud audiences. Collectively they have developed a curriculum in the Cloud Cookbook that helps a majority of NASA Earthdata users access data in the cloud. Just at the 2023 AGU Fall Meeting, there were 4 workshops using these common materials, two used the 2i2c JupyterHub, and we had 12 talks and posters that described different elements of the transition to the cloud. And in every slide deck the participating DAACs are recognized and acknowledged. This is a stunning amount of presented work from any group, and we hope that you all feel very proud.\n\nThe NASA Mentors group has rapidly identified user needs and developed resources. Two examples of that are:\nFirst, earthaccess, a Python library being developed openly on GitHub. The initial mechanism to access NASA data in the cloud required 30 lines of bash code that created a netrc file and adding earthdata login credentials to that file to get the AWS Secret keys. This as a first step for a new user to the cloud is a high barrier to entry. Luis Lopez from the NSIDC DAAC led the development of this package and we are grateful for the flexibility and support from NSDIC DAAC to meet this emergent need. Earthaccess now obscures those steps for the user with a single line of Python, and it works across DAACs easily accessing data from NSIDC, LP DAAC, PO.DAAC, and others. It is one of the things that most users comment about being a highlight. Also this early intervention means that just dozens of users experienced the clunky initial approach, but thousands of users moving forward will just know the easy earthaccess approach. We’ve worked directly with R and MATLAB developers from our networks who have developed R and MATLAB libraries as complements to earthaccess, which further enable a large swath of Earthdata users.\nSecond, cheatsheets. We know that Cloud jargon is intense. Cassie Nickles and Catalina Taglialatela from PO.DAAC spearheaded a set of cheat sheets that new users can refer to as they navigate planning and executing their transition to the cloud. They intentionally created them to meet PO.DAAC’s needs but in a way that was generalized so that all DAACs could use them so they are heavily reused in presentations and workshops.\nThere are so many other examples that we could provide of ways creating this space for these folks to work together has led to increased efficiency, overall better support for new users moving to the cloud and has avoided significant friction and frustration that users might have had if each DAAC was working alone. In the last three years, we have seen significant, exciting scientific advances in NASA Earthdata users’ ability to work in the cloud and this is in part thanks to your teams and your investment. Mindsets as leaders across DAACs and in the broader Open Science community\nToday, most DAACs have at least one mentor who is a Carpentries Instructor (many have undergone certification). This is something that our grant paid for and the benefits to each DAAC we hope will pay dividends for better teaching of many topics. All of the mentors are more comfortable teaching the Cloud Cookbook material and live coding in the 2i2c Hub than they were at the beginning. Each DAAC is able to leverage the collective resources for DAAC-specific workshops (a lot of value for a fraction of the cost). Many DAAC staff beyond the named mentors access the 2i2c Hub for DAAC-specific tutorial development, so they also have seen an increase in efficiency utilizing services that our grant and now contract provide.\nI hope that you can see that all of this work is aligned with the mission you are all supporting and not extra. Each mentor gives about .2WYE (work year equivalents) and we estimate that last year we had between 4 and 5 WYE total across the DAACs, in addition to the staff support that our NASA Openscapes team (Erin, Julie, Stefanie) provides ~ 1-2 WYE.\n\n\nGoing forward: the next two years\nWe started this project three years ago. Our hope was to connect with all the DAACs by the end of the award, to build instructor capacity and common tutorial material, and to leave the DAACs in a place where they would continue to sustain the work we started together transitioning users to the cloud.\nIn the next two years the Openscapes team (Erin, Julie and Stefanie) will phase out our involvement in the DAAC support, starting with Erin in July. The user support tasks will not go away at that point. We have been in discussions with Justin over the last eight months about this and have begun to set up scaffolding that documents the process and allows the systems to continue. Likely, when we step fully away it will require 5-6 WYE’s across the DAAC\nWe’d like to use this time to answer any questions you might have, discuss alignment across the DAACs, identify better ways we can support you all and how each of you see your DAACs contributing to this investment. Thank you, we appreciate you and continue to be so grateful for all the time that DAACs have put towards this work.\n\n\n\nSome NASA Openscapes Mentors and colleagues holding puppies at the AGU 2023 conference #NASAPuppyPorters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{robinson2024,\n  author = {Robinson, Erin and Lowndes (Openscapes), Julie and\n    Openscapes Team, NASA},\n  title = {NASA {Openscapes:} {Talking} Points for 3-Year Recap \\&\n    Vision for Next Two Years},\n  date = {2024-02-15},\n  url = {https://openscapes.org/blog/2024-02-15-nasa-openscapes-talking-points/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nRobinson, Erin, Julie Lowndes (Openscapes), and NASA Openscapes Team.\n2024. “NASA Openscapes: Talking Points for 3-Year Recap &\nVision for Next Two Years.” February 15, 2024. https://openscapes.org/blog/2024-02-15-nasa-openscapes-talking-points/."

If you do it yourself, this involves creating an AWS Account, connecting to an EC2 instance, and using resources like the Earthdata Cloud Primer for more setup and cost management information. If you use a managed Cloud service, organizations like 2i2c can provide Cloud-hosted JupyterHubs for research and education. Your institution may also support smaller or larger scale options."

While the script was run from Amy’s local computer, the data processing steps were run on the Cloud using Coiled Functions for running Python functions on Cloud virtual machines (VMs). This approach was particularly convenient as it allows existing Python functions to be run in the Cloud by lightly annotating them with a @coiled.function decorator.\nThis workflow benefited from running on the Cloud because the ICESat-2 mission data was already stored on the Cloud in S3, so moving the data processing to be co-located next to the data avoided data transfers, which are both slow and expensive."

    "text": "The NOAA Enterprise Data Management Workshop (EDMW) is an annual workshop organized by NOAA staff and affiliates. The purpose of the workshop is to build on past work in enterprise data management at NOAA by highlighting progress, identifying issues, fostering discussions, and determining where new technologies can be applied. This year’s theme is “Bridging the Gap: Ensuring Seamless Data Flow from Acquisition to Access”\nNASA Openscapes was invited to present via Bri Lind (NASA Land Processes data center, LP DAAC). Julie Lowndes (Openscapes) & Ian Carroll (NASA Ocean Biology data center, OB.DAAC) will co-present.\nHow the NASA Openscapes community supports Earthdata users migrating workflows to the Cloud\nAbstract: NASA Openscapes is a community where staff with similar roles supporting users across 12 NASA Earth Science Data Centers (DAACs) have been able to learn, develop common tutorials, and teach together to support users migrating workflows to the Cloud. NASA Openscapes Mentors co-create and maintain an open Earthdata Cloud Cookbook of common reusable open source tutorials that they have co-developed for specific audiences and tested and refined through frequent workshops, hackathons, and Openscapes Champions Cohorts. They also created the earthaccess Python library which made users’ first experience with NASA Earthdata Cloud be two lines of Python code rather than 30 lines of bash code (that also required clicking and managing hidden files for authentication). The work these Mentors do together as a small community has enormous cascading effects, particularly as they visibly practice open science daily via contributions to open source code and documentation. Further, they are connected to other open communities to enable further innovation: like when a conversation at the Ecological Society of America conference led to building the earthdatalogin R library to support researchers R as well as Python and create portable docker containers cloud users. We will share stories and how we work, and how approaches fit and can be leveraged by the NOAA Enterprise Data Management community."

    "text": "On April 22, 2025 Openscapes hosted a Community Call to share what we’re learning about cloud costs for Earth science workflows in our JupyterHubs. We are working deeply with NASA Openscapes Mentors and NOAA Openscapes Mentors to use, teach, and develop with 2i2c; and increasingly have cross-NASA collaborations with other hubs like the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) and CryoCloud. This was a first conversation. There is so much more to share than we had time for, and there was a lot more interest in questions and community examples. Through a light interview structure, Andy Teucher (Openscapes), Alex Lewandowski (NASA Alaska Satellite Facility), Eli Holmes (NOAA Fisheries), Tasha Snow (CryoCloud), and Yuvi (2i2c) shared their experiences and what they are building.\nQuick links:\nOpenscapes and our partners at NASA, NOAA, and 2i2c have been learning together about monitoring and managing the costs of cloud computing in a JupyterHub. Many organizations are starting to use cloud computing for computational analysis and teaching workshops, often using JupyterHubs as the platform for this work.  Tracking usage and attributing costs to specific users and workflows can be tricky on these shared hubs, and we have been learning some strategies and tools to help us understand them. The purpose of this Community Call was to share what we’ve learned so far: tools and processes to explore cloud costs, as well as figures like the basic costs for hosting a hub, cost per user, cost per science workflow, and what it costs to run a workshop in the hub.\nOne punchline: yes it is possible to run real science workflows in different Hubs – and we can estimate the costs. An example workflow transported from Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) OpenSARLab to NASA Openscapes Hub cost $0.74. This cost does not reflect the cost of technical infrastructure & development, plus the training and upskilling the researcher needs. When comparing costs, it is important to keep in mind that different JupyterHubs have different focuses (e.g., data type(s) and usage patterns) and, consequently, different architectures that can greatly affect costs even for similar workflows. Yet, it is an exciting step in understanding the cost of earth science workflows in the cloud!\nThe format of the call was several stories and demos from this cutting-edge collaboration between open source infrastructure, government agencies, science communities (slides). Here is the story arc, and a few key notes."

Participants learned hands-on techniques for accessing TEMPO Level-3 data using the Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub in AWS Cloud—approaches that directly support NASA’s Open Science principles by making data more accessible and analyses more efficient and easy to collaborate on.\nTackling Real Challenges Together\nThe workshop addressed a common challenge: satellite data stored in traditional HDF and netCDF formats can be slow to access and download from the cloud. A collaborative team spanning NASA DAACs (Distributed Active Archive Centers), Openscapes, OPeNDAP (Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol), and open source contributors is working to solve this through innovative approaches like DMR++ reference files and VirtualiZarr tools that create “virtual datasets” without requiring massive downloads.\nThe hands-on session featured engaging experimentation with TEMPO satellite data, where participants explored treating individual data granules as virtual datasets. The collaborative discussion also identified concrete opportunities to improve tools like earthaccess to make virtual datacube workflows even more user-friendly.\nLearning and Improving Together\nWhat made this workshop especially valuable was the community learning approach. Based on the discussion and participant feedback, future workshops will incorporate several enhancements:\n\nEnhanced preparation: Pre-workshop surveys to understand participants’ specific use-cases, and technical prerequisites checklist to reduce workshop setup time\nMore time and structure: Extended 3+ hour sessions (or multiple sessions) with dedicated troubleshooting time, breakouts into small groups, and an associated Slack channel\nClearer examples: Tiered/increasing complexity examples, including “failure cases” that show technology limitations\nVisual learning aids: Additional diagrams showing how tools connect and development status/timelines\nPractical next steps: Decision trees for choosing approaches, before/after workflow comparisons with performance metrics, and clear guidance for applying techniques to participants’ own research post-workshop\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{kaufman2025,\n  author = {Kaufman, Daniel},\n  title = {Cloud {Access} {Mini-Workshop} with {TEMPO}},\n  date = {2025-09-09},\n  url = {https://openscapes.org/blog/2025-09-09-tempo-workshop/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nKaufman, Daniel. 2025. “Cloud Access Mini-Workshop with\nTEMPO.” September 9, 2025. https://openscapes.org/blog/2025-09-09-tempo-workshop/."

    "section": "NASA Champions Cohort Overview",
    "text": "NASA Champions Cohort Overview\nThe NASA Openscapes Project is a multi-year project to develop a cohesive approach to building Cloud migration capacity across NASA Earthdata from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) and the research teams that the DAACs support. We do this through supporting a community of NASA DAAC mentors, who are primarily dedicated to user support. This community has learned together how to use NASA Earthdata on the Cloud. They have translated that experience into a series of Hackathons, workshops, self-paced tutorial material in the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, and through an intensive, 10-week program: NASA Openscapes Champions.\nCloud migration can often have a steep learning curve and feel overwhelming. The NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort brings together research teams that are interested in migrating their existing NASA Earthdata workflows to the Cloud with NASA DAAC Mentors who are extremely knowledgeable about the data they serve and the initial pathways to using that data on the Cloud. This Cohort provides a common, welcoming place for teams to learn together, ask questions about using the Cloud, plan their transition, and do initial experimentation using the NASA Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub. Because this is a more intensive experience, the teams build collaborative partnerships with DAAC mentors, and the mentors can more quickly identify and work on solving issues that will make Cloud migration easier for many more users. We led the first NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort in 2022.\nThe second NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort ran formally in April-June 2023 with seven research teams interested in a wide variety of NASA Earthdata and various stages of Cloud technology familiarity. You can learn more about their research below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoomie (♥️) of some researchers in the 2023 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort\n\nTogether as a Champions Cohort, these teams discussed what worked and didn’t work as they migrated workflows to the Cloud, focusing on collaboration and open science. We met as a cohort five times over two months on alternating Wednesdays. Each cohort call included a welcome and code of conduct reminder, two teaching sessions with time for reflection in small groups or silent journaling and group discussion, before closing with suggestions for future team meeting topics (“Seaside Chats”), Efficiency Tips, and Tips. All topics and the slides presented are shared on the 2023 Cohort page. Additional coworking sessions were scheduled on alternate weeks, where researchers could work quietly, screenshare to ask questions or meet with their team to discuss further. In addition, the teams have access to Openscapes’ 2i2c Jupyter Hub, which will continue for the next year. \nThanks to the NASA Openscapes Mentors for supporting the Champions and for their contributions to the curriculum! In particular, the NASA Openscapes Champions Curriculum had significant additions: \n\nAndy Barrett from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) created a version of Data Strategies for Future Us that is applicable to gridded, remotely sensed data. Slides are here: https://nsidc.github.io/data_strategies_for_future_us/data_strategies_slides#/title-slide \nAmy Steiker and Luis Lopez from NSIDC and Alexis Hunzinger from Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) refactored the Coding Strategies for Future Us to be tailored to NASA Earthdata search, the earthaccess python library, and experiences from teams at Goddard DAAC (GES DISC) that have learned to use the Cloud. \nAmy Steiker from NSIDC designed and led the Earthdata Cloud Clinic! This was a hands-on 1-hour clinic that allowed teams to get familiar with the 2i2c JupyterHub, and practice finding and accessing NASA Earthdata via direct access through two methods from a Jupyter Notebook: earthaccess and Harmony-py services. This material can be found in the cookbook here -&gt; https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/examples/Earthdata-cloud-clinic.html \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Amy Steiker teaching the Earthdata Clinic. We used Zoom’s “green check mark” feature during pauses for people to indicate that they had completed a step.\n\n\nCassie Nickles screenshared and introduced the Earthdata Cookbook and NASA Earthdata Cloud cheatsheets in the final cohort call to help teams understand available resources moving forward."

    "section": "Shared Lessons Learned",
    "text": "Shared Lessons Learned\nThe Openscapes Champions provides a space for teams to come together to learn from each other and across teams. It is a way to collaborate and distribute leadership across teams and reduce the burden on the team leader feeling the need to learn everything first to teach it to the rest of the team. Below are just a few things we’ve learned and are carrying forward. \nUnderstanding ‘When to Cloud.’ The Cloud makes some things easier and some things harder. Over the series of five synchronous cohort calls, we considered when Cloud is effective and when the download model may still be more appropriate. Andy Barrett highlighted some considerations in Call 2 on Data Strategies for Future Us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Andy’s slides.\n\nWhen to Cloud is a recent addition as an early chapter of the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook and will evolve as we continue to learn when to Cloud and when not to. Kudos to Alexis Hunzinger from GES DISC for leading this effort.\nUndifferentiated Heavy Lifting - `earthaccess` for the win! Jeff Bezos coined this term in his 2006 keynote describing AWS doing undifferentiated heavy lifting so that everyone doesn’t have to do the mucky parts. The NASA DAAC Mentors’ work with research teams allows them to identify places of friction that, if fixed once, would benefit many users. One of the places the NASA DAAC mentors, led by Luis Lopez, have done this is with earthaccess, a Python library to search, download or stream NASA Earth science data with just a few lines of code. Luis described earthaccess in a video demo we shared in Call 3, and the Cohort used earthaccess in Call 4. We heard over and over how useful earthaccess was to the Cohort teams. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom chat from a researcher in the 2023 Champions Cohort, who also participated in the 2021 Cloud Hackathon which preceded `earthaccess` development.\n\nHowever, several challenges working with NASA Earthdata in the Cloud are still unresolved. These include: \n\nWe have made the first steps to migrating to the Cloud possible, but workflows are generally designed for serial processing. Refactoring code to take advantage of parallelization and scaling available in the Cloud isn’t a skillset we have on our project team. \nOur Cloud tutorials have been Python-centric, and Champions research teams use a variety of languages, including R, Matlab, IDL, and Fortran. File formats - particularly HDF4 and HDFEOS - that some teams used aren’t as straightforward to use in the Cloud. \nThe 2i2c JuypterHub is a great resource for initial experimentation, but teams do not necessarily want to depend on the Hub. The hurdle to go from accessing the Cloud through a GitHub login in a browser to interacting with the AWS console interface is giant. It also requires a credit card, which leads to the most consistent challenge - it is still difficult to understand how much the Cloud will cost."

    "section": "Gaining Cloud Momentum",
    "text": "Gaining Cloud Momentum\nPart of the Openscapes Champions approach is that teams decide what to work on. The teams devoted at least 8 hours a month to focus on their workflows, learning, and collaborating within and across their teams. During this time, they thought through and discussed their current NASA Earthdata workflows and planned and experimented with transitioning their workflows to the Cloud using Openscapes’ 2i2c-hosted Jupyter Hub as a first step. As in other Openscapes Champions cohorts, teams also realized the power of Open science and that open is a spectrum that includes considering future us - potentially just you or your group in 3 months. \nWe saw teams and the NASA DAAC mentors make significant progress in migrating workflows to the Cloud. A few highlights from teams that participated in the cohort included: \n\nThe Geoweaver team made a Python version of Geoweaver, pyGeoweaver, and contributed a tutorial to the EarthData Cloud Cookbook! \nThe CLIMCAPS Team did initial experiments with earthaccess. They found it was a factor of 2 faster, but expected a more significant increase in speed.\nThe HEAT Team was able to access data through earthaccess and bring it into Geopandas. They have additional work to do to use the Cloud to process data to connect to other services like GIOVANNI. \nThe S-MODE Team made initial progress using earthaccess with S-MODE data. They had challenges being able to only access one file at a time. \nThe Hydrometeorology and GESTAR Teams connected with our MathWorks contacts and made progress accessing NASA Earthdata in the Cloud via MATLAB. We’ve submitted a talk at the AGU fall conference about this, stay tuned!\nThe LASERS Team had experience with Google Earth Engine and spent some time trying to use AWS for the same tasks. They also noted how their Cloud collaboration was a pathway toward more open, collaborative work across their team."

While the cohort is officially over, these teams are just at the beginning, and we are excited to follow their results. Several Champions will participate in Carpentries Instructor Training this summer; The Carpentries is a nonprofit that teaches introductory coding skills around the world, Instructor Training is not coding-specific, but it is a pedagogical approach to teaching technical topics. As part of our NASA grant, we partner with The Carpentries and are excited to extend this opportunity to Champions since many of them mentioned wanting to contribute more to open science efforts going forward.\nWe are grateful to this Champion Cohort’s early adopter spirit, their time and effort to make this migration and all of the feedback and input they provided. They all participated in this cohort, knowing that while this was the second Cohort, they were among the first research teams to use NASA Earthdata in the Cloud. What they learned and shared will make it easier for subsequent teams to make this same shift. Many teams articulated this spirit of Open leadership, explicitly asking how they could help other teams. We also learned so much, and we will refine the NASA Openscapes Champions as we plan for our next cohort and our work with the DAAC mentors in the future years of our project."

These include (i) MERRA-2 and (ii) the MEASURES CAMEL dataset. We distribute CLIMCAPS as Level 2 and Level 3 files to a range of different users. Our research focuses on maintaining/improving the CLIMCAPS algorithm and collaborating with users to improve and tailor CLIMCAPS data products. Since releasing the CLIMCAPS record via GES DISC in 2020 (2002–present), we have seen our user base grow. We have had the chance to collaborate with many groups. This gave us the opportunity to address their questions, clarify the product and help prepare custom Level 3 files that are tailored to target applications. The CLIMCAPS Level 2 product contains many different types of uncertainty metrics that can be used to filter and refine data usage. We would absolutely love the opportunity to make these workflows, that we’ve helped develop for users, more widely available. I have no doubt that other communities will find it useful also, and we want, in turn, to learn from others. Experience is teaching us that good science happens when developers and scientists collaborate together. And this is why I think Cloud-based workflows is one of the most exciting technology advances in recent years.\nHEAT (HydroEnergy Analytics Team) There is an increasing global demand for food, water and energy mainly driven by rapid urbanization, rising population, economic growth and regional conflicts. As water, energy and food are interconnected and are part of a system, we will adopt an integrated Water-Energy-Food Nexus (W-E-F) approach to examine the interdependence of water, energy and food and the impacts of climate change on water, energy, and food consumption in Nepal. Nepal, a country located in Southeast Asia, presents a unique case, where the datasets are either sparse, extremely challenging to obtain, or unavailable. Assessing W-E-F Nexus is particularly challenging due to gaps in datasets and lack of long-term observations. NASA’s Earth Observation data can be used to overcome these obstacles by providing ongoing long-term observations of the planet at various spatial and temporal resolutions, effectively filling in the gaps in the data. Our approach involves utilizing data-driven techniques to analyze the W-E-F nexus at watershed level in Nepal. Specifically, we plan to combine NASA’s Earth Observation data with hydropower generation, agricultural production and socioeconomic data in Nepal to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the W-E-F nexus in the region. We have identified several potential datasets, and will address two major questions in the cohort: 1) How has water availability, hydropower generation and consumption, demographics, crop yield changed in Nepal over the last 20 years? 2) What is the relationship between change in hydropower generation with respect to changes in hydrometeorology and demographics? Outcome: We will develop a Jupyter Notebook that outlines a comprehensive method for generating outputs from data acquisition using a Cloud environment. This end-to-end process will be clearly described in the notebook, providing an intuitive and efficient workflow that can be replicated by others adhering to the open science principles. Through this effort, we aim to facilitate the use of Cloud computing in data analysis and dissemination, streamlining the research process and enabling more efficient collaboration among researchers. The final Jupyter Notebook will be shared in the collaborative space (GitHub). The pain points encountered from an interdisciplinary user’s perspective will be documented.\nLASERS Team Our team has expertise in assessing vegetation biophysical parameters using data from all platforms, terrestrial, airborne and spaceborne. We have experience in using the Google Earth Engine and ICESat-2 data to produce gridded-maps of canopy height and canopy cover and we have produced open science software tools for displaying and labeling ICESat-2 photons, e.g., PhotonLabeler, or Waveformlidar, both available on GitHub. Our research efforts of producing Landsat-resolution gridded maps of canopy height, canopy cover, and biomass, are limited in scale by using local computing and data download-intensive approaches. Educational accounts on Cloud-based platforms, such as GEE, have limitations for data availability, data volume and modeling options, and the learning curve and cost for migrating to platforms like AWS, have their own challenges. As such, we hope that by joining NASA’s Openscapes we’ll remove barriers to producing timely vegetation products at continental and global scales to better answer pressing questions in ecology while empowering students and young scientists to use Cloud-computing and open science tools. We use ICESat-2 data, Landsat, and derived data to characterize vegetation structure and estimate biophysical parameters, such as height, cover, biomass. For producing gridded maps of vegetation parameters at scales larger than regional, e.g., continental and global, the volume of data download and processing time are hampering the workflow, therefore we intend to migrate the process to the Cloud.\nGeoweaver Team Our group has a lot of interests and collaboration history with DAACs and the Earth science community, and we are dedicated to developing Geoweaver to support Earth science teams as well as DAAC staff (data pipeline, ingestion, migration, analytics) to be productive, and their work are tangible and FAIR for other scientists to reproduce. We use NASA data as input variables to AI models to train the models with the ability to discover Earth insights in time and be actionable. We are very interested in migrating the workflow into the Cloud because that is where the data is and there are data retrieval and I/O steps in our workflows which are slow if they are executed outside the Cloud. By migrating workflows into Cloud, we want to experiment and showcase that: (1) scientists can easily switch from their personal computing environments to Cloud environment seamlessly and effortlessly using Geoweaver; (2) the hybrid collaboration environment provided by NASA and researchers’ home institution, including their laptops, can work together for one single workflow (/purpose) without under-using (wasting) resources; (3) make the building-testing-debugging iteration more quick, useful, transparent, and of course FAIR (Geoweaver records everything people did no matter where) and help scientists get serious about workflow run history sharing in a single zip file; (4) show that Geoweaver is a click-button solution if scientists want to deploy their AI workflows into operational services to run periodically like every day.\nS-MODE Team Our group has a wide range of professional experience, ranging from graduate students to PI’s. Everyone in our group is interested in exploring open-source workflows on the Cloud and building machinery to analyze a variety of data from S-MODE (Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment). Our collaboration will benefit the general S-MODE community as we plan on sharing our findings. Our overall goal is to foster a data analysis community for S-MODE by creating machinery that can be used by many research groups. From Mackenzie: “I work with NASA funded saildrone data to investigate submesoscale dynamics of the upper ocean and air-sea interactions. Specifically, I am working with saildrone datasets from the Atlantic Tradewind Ocean Atmosphere Interaction Campaign (ATOMIC) and S-MODE. I analyze the saildrone data using python and Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, I use satellite data from SMAP, Aquarius, and SWOT to provide environmental context on where the saildrone data was collected. I currently download most of the datasets and keep them on my university’s HPC system. I use open-source software to analyze the data, which includes python packages such as Xarray, numpy, matplotlib, cartopy, and pandas.”\nHydrometeorology Team We are highly motivated to migrate our ground validation workflow for the NASA GPM - Global Precipitation Measurement product to the Cloud. With over a decade of experience working with ground weather radar products and developing comprehensive workflows for ground validation work, we are eager to streamline and optimize our process. We use NASA data in three areas. First, we conduct cross-validation between NASA GPM products and NOAA ground weather radar products. Second, we create synergy of multiple NASA remote sensing measurements to achieve better precipitation product. Third, we apply NASA remote sensing data to monitor and forecast natural hazards such as flash flooding, drought, tornado, etc. Our team recognizes the numerous benefits that Cloud computing resources can provide. Firstly, Cloud services are highly scalable and can easily accommodate changes in demand from other scientists. Secondly, by migrating our workflow to the Cloud, we can automate many tasks and improve efficiency while reducing the risk of errors or delays. Thirdly, Cloud computing resources are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easier to collaborate with other scientists. Lastly, Cloud services can be integrated with other tools and services, such as machine learning or data analytics platforms, enhancing the overall capabilities of the workflow. We strongly believe that ground validation efforts require a global approach, and migrating our ground validation workflow to the Cloud can greatly enhance our ability to collaborate with other scientists and improve our work on a global scale.\nGESTAR Team We conduct sensor calibration, mission support and support data applications. I work in the GESTAR2 group (Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research II) at UMBC (University of Maryland, Baltimore County). Our team, lead by Dr. Strow with us has been responsible for the development of the CHIRP (Climate Hyperspectral Radiance Product) now being hosted on GES DISC DAAC and intimately concerned with the Aqua AIRS, NOAA CrIS MetOP IASI sensors so that their data can be used for climate studies. We are heavily invested in Matlab with C and Fortran libraries. We deal with 10s of TB data almost daily using the HPC at UMBC - a fantastic resource. There is an interest and growing incentive to migrate to the Cloud, but for us the capital (of effort) to ‘re-locate’ is very significant. We need to understand the cost/benefit in our situation. There is a very steep learning curve and very little time available and there isn’t a one solution to fit all."

As part of this effort we are openly developing the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook: a compilation of open source tutorials, workflows, and cheatsheets that we have refined through teaching over 20 Cloud workshops with researchers using NASA Earthdata. We support NASA Earthdata users by developing an open science mindset focused on kindness, as well as developing software to reduce time to science and meet researchers where they are. The earthaccess library and corn base image helps researchers access NASA Earthdata in a few lines of code – in Python, R, and MATLAB. We will share about this ongoing work and how we collaborate to share lessons learned and tackle challenges together - and welcome you to join the open science movement."

    "section": "Project Impact Summary Years 1-3",
    "text": "Project Impact Summary Years 1-3\nNASA Openscapes is a multi-year effort to grow a cross-DAAC Mentor community supporting Open NASA Earth Science in the Cloud. Looking back from where we started in February 2020: we have changed the way NASA teaches Cloud. There is now a way to teach Cloud, and we have built and supported a growing community of learner-oriented empathetic teachers who are user-support staff from across 11 DAACs. These “NASA Openscapes Mentors” practice open science daily to create a common set of tutorials, organize and lead virtual, hybrid, and in-person workshops, and have a feedback & review process for tutorial creation and teaching. The successes and momentum of NASA Openscapes is due to the Mentors having paid time as part of their jobs to collaborate and learn together. NASA Openscapes work is not extra: it is the “how” to do the work aligned with DAAC and broader NASA goals. We are appreciative of DAAC Managers and NASA leadership for supporting Mentors’ time.\nIn Year 3, we have focused on “operational hardening” to formalize processes, move toward sustainability, communicate impact, and engage more expansively with the broader open community. We report on this as a new first section, adding to the sections included in Year 1&2 Annual Reports. 2023 is the Year of Open Science, and we have continued to be active members of the global open science community, amplifying NASA work and connecting with and amplifying collaborator efforts. Throughout this project, we have not only used technology, but we’ve collaborated with technology builders to improve the user/learner experience for these technologies for Open science and Cloud. This includes 2i2c and Jupyter, Quarto from Posit/RStudio; OPeNDAP, MATLAB from Mathworks, the R community, Coiled, as well as connected communities across NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, EPA, Black in Marine Science (BIMS), BWEEMS, Fred Hutch Cancer Center, and beyond.\nWe approach this work as movement building. We developed the Openscapes Flywheel, an open source tool – we reach for this tool for planning, progress, and impact tracking as we would reach for R and Quarto for data analysis and documentation. We developed it with NASA Earth science Mentors, using the concept where transformations occur from consistently doing key activities that add up over time (Collins). The Flywheel supports teams across NASA DAACs to to grow morale and technical capacity across their organizations by (1) Engage bright spots, through welcoming them and creating space and place; (2) Empower a learning culture through investing in learning and trust and working openly (3) Amplify Open science leaders, through leveraging the common and inspiring the bigger movement (Robinson & Lowndes 2022). \nThrough this work, some highlights of impact to date:\n(1 Engage): 11 DAACs participating (NSIDC, PO.DAAC, LP DAAC, GES DISC, ASDC, ASF, ORNL, SEDAC, GHRC, OB.DAAC, LAADS) (and we will join the 12th CDDIS’s first User Working Group in January 2024); have a JupyterHub and Notebook-Quarto-GitHub workflow for documentation and publishing; have co-created a consistent set of tutorials, teaching style, and mindset; co-led the 2021 Cloud Hackathon and 2022+2023 Champions programs; have documented our work through the Flywheel publication and Approach Guide; and have given many “imagine what’s possible” talks & keynotes about NASA Openscapes work – including the global announcement of Quarto and a talk on Documenting Things that describes 3 approaches to onboarding NASA Mentors. \n(2 Empower): Mentors have led 10+ workshops internally with DAAC staff and externally with researchers; developed the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook; Reused tutorials, slides, graphics and facilitation and open practices; were more aware cross-DAAC, less recreating; from user feedback developed Cheatsheets and the earthaccess python library; wrote the Value of Hosted JupyterHubs (White paper RFI); Collaborating on Hackweeks, developed 2i2c access guidelines and onboard/offboard approach; and also started meeting regularly with Openscapes Mentors from NASA, EPA, Fred Hutch, and Pathways to Open Science, connecting about challenges and opportunities beyond NASA – we developed coaching skills that make us better open data science mentors and co-authored a preprint called  Shifting institutional culture to develop climate solutions with Open Science that is now in peer-review. We now support R and MATLAB users in 2 ways (as we do python users): Python, R, and MATLAB part of the 2i2c JupyterHub (via corn environment); and we teach how to work in these languages: partnering with Mathworks and Carl Boettiger, who have created `earthaccess` equivalent approaches and identifying needs for dev and teaching to support.\n(3 Amplify): Mentors are amplifying across-DAACs and beyond: Career advancement & bringing mindset to new places; Speaking up in other meetings (User Needs TIM, TRAIN, Cloud Playground conversations); Connecting & consulting based on experiences - Pathfinder for 2i2c, comparing w/ SMCE; AWS; Engaging beyond (Pangeo Forge, LoL, pyOpenSci).\nFrom one Mentor, Cassandra Nickles (PO.DAAC):\n\nOpenscapes has created a collaborative environment for DAAC staff to collectively support open science initiatives for NASA Earthdata users. It enables us to work more openly with other DAACs toward our common goal of supporting the Earthdata ecosystem. We’ve developed awesome material to help Earthdata users such asworkflow cheatsheets, a python package (earthaccess), and data recipes hosted in the cross-DAACNASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook. Perhaps just as important as what we’ve done however, are mindsets we’ve grown into along the way. It’s okay to share imperfect works in progress. The virtual environment can be conducive to laughter and connection. Ideas are not too big or too small to share. We are better at dreaming and implementing the future together."

    "text": "Why NASA Earthdata? Why Openscapes?\nWe are getting these questions a lot, so here is our take.\nNASA Earth Science Data Systems missions collect Earth data, including sea ice, physical oceanography, vegetation and many other parameters – data used by researchers around the world for many different purposes, including answering pressing questions in ecology and environmental science. Further, NASA promotes open science – from the NASA Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program 2020 Highlights report:\n\nOpen data are the foundation of ESDS efforts to fulfill the program’s vision of accelerating scientific advancement for societal benefit through innovative Earth science data stewardship and technology development….to leverage global Earth science communities to advance open science.\n\nOpenscapes’ long-term goal is to enable robust, and enduring science- and data-driven solutions to global and time-sensitive challenges. We approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. We see data analysis and stewardship as entryways to meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skill sets and mindsets while empowering them as leaders. With NASA support, the project team and the partners, the Openscapes Framework fundamentally changes the paradigm for supporting research teams and DAAC mentors, first to work more openly with their teams on the cloud, and ultimately to advance open science!"

    "section": "Partners",
    "text": "Partners\nThis project allows us to partner with organizations that share Openscapes’ values of open science:\n\n2i2c develops, deploys, customizes, and manages open source tools and cloud services for interactive computing in research and education. They deploy community-driven infrastructure, inspired by use-cases such as the UC Berkeley DataHubs and the Pangeo project, that provides easy “one-click-to-cloud” access with Jupyter Notebooks through the web browser designed to reduce the startup burden for new learners, and this approach will also benefit the NASA DAAC community.\nThe Carpentries teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. The Carpentries supported mentors with Instructor Training through in Years 1-3."
