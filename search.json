    "text": "Overview\nOpenscapes is an approach for doing better science in less time1. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science2, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\nOpenscapes Champions is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. For NASA Openscapes, research teams will also spend time experimenting and planning what their analytical workflows with NASA Earthdata look like in the Cloud. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/ Python/ MATLAB, GitHub, metadata, cloud), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.\nNASA Openscapes is a 3-year project to support scientists using data from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud. As part of this work, we will offer the Openscapes Champions program several times from 2022-2024."

Mentors teach and support in opportunities of different types: Hackathons, Workshops, and the Openscapes Champions program. We expect a range of technical ability and teaching experience. Through these growth opportunities within a broader community engagement approach, Mentors will also gain visibility for their work as well as for their DAACs. The expected time commitment is 3 days/month per year (and this ebbs and flows with your deadlines). We have 1.5 hour Mentor Calls (planning) every 2 weeks and Coworking calls (screensharing and doing) and asynchronous work in between. The majority of your time will be spent self-directed towards improving support approaches for specific DAACs, and you’ll be collaborating with others at your DAAC as well as across DAACs and the broader open science community.\nPlease also see how we onboard documentation – this is part of the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook that is the main place for all cloud resources the Mentors are developing."

We kickoff those calls with about 10 mins of check in and agenda design and then we will move to proposed topics. In alternating weeks, we have Coworking sessions to work on shared goals together, screensharing and often working in the 2i2c JupyterHub and in GitHub.\n\nWinter & Spring - We have twice-monthly Mentor Calls and Coworking sessions in alternating weeks. February-May focused extended Coworking sessions to be Cookbook Hackdays. Mentors collaborated leading workshops and talks.\nSpring Champions Cohort - We supported 7 research teams to learn, discuss, and plan what transitioning their workflows with NASA Earthdata could look like in the Cloud.\nSummer and ESIP meeting - In July and August we planned to take a break from our biweekly calls to let this group rest. However, there was interest to keep the momentum and ability to collaborate with anyone available, so we have continued to host biweekly calls and move forward with AGU workshop proposals, and have guest speakers. In July many Mentors met in person at the ESIP Summer Conference in Vermont, including for a one-day retreat-workshop to shape sustainability plans for the group.\nFall - We will have our first Mentor Call with the full group of mentors on Sept 20 - to introduce everyone and orient around the NASA Openscapes project. Our initial call will include sharing plans, UWGs and other events on the calendar and continuing onboarding new DAAC mentors. In preparing for AGU workshops in December, returning DAAC mentors will lead teaching dry runs with the cloud tutorials as a way to onboard the group to data access in the cloud and to get your fresh perspective on our existing material. (What works? What’s confusing?). Our Mentor Calls are on alternating Wednesdays from 10-11:30 PT, starting Sept 20. We also cowork on specific topics in alternating weeks.

We approach this work as movement building, and developed the Openscapes Flywheel with NASA Earth science data centers, using the concept where transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time. The Flywheel supports teams across NASA DAACs to to grow morale and technical capacity across their organizations by (1) Engage bright spots, through welcoming them and creating space and place; (2) Empower a learning culture through investing in learning and trust and working openly (3) Amplify Open science leaders, through leveraging the common and inspiring the bigger movement (Robinson & Lowndes 2022).\nThrough this work, some highlights of impact to date: (1 Engage): 7 DAACs participating (NSIDC, PO.DAAC, LP DAAC, GES DISC, ASDC, ASF, ORNL); have a JupyterHub and Notebook-Quarto-GitHub workflow for documentation and publishing; have co-created a consistent set of tutorials, teaching style, and mindset; co-led the 2021 Cloud Hackathon and 2022 Champions program; have documented our work through the Flywheel pub and Approach Guide; and given many invited talks & keynotes. (2 Empower): Mentors have led 10 Workshops: internal with DAAC staff and external with researchers; developed the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook; Reused tutorials, slides, graphics and facilitation and open practices; were more aware cross-DAAC, less recreating; from user feedback developed Cheatsheets and the earthaccess python library; wrote the Value of Hosted JupyterHubs (White paper RFI); Collaborating on Hackweeks, 2i2c cont’d access after workshops. (3 Amplify): Mentors are amplifying across-DAACs and beyond: Career advancement & bringing mindset to new places; Speaking up in other meetings (User Needs TIM, TRAIN, Cloud Playground); Connecting & consulting based on experiences - Pathfinder for 2i2c, comparing w/ SMCE; AWS; Engaging beyond (Pangeo Forge, Ladies of Landsat, pyOpenSci)."

    "section": "Why NASA Earthdata? Why Openscapes?",
    "text": "Why NASA Earthdata? Why Openscapes?\nWe are getting these questions a lot, so here is our take.\nNASA Earth Science Data Systems missions collect Earth data, including sea ice, physical oceanography, vegetation and many other parameters – data used by researchers around the world for many different purposes, including answering pressing questions in ecology and environmental science. Further, NASA promotes open science – from the NASA Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program 2020 Highlights report:\n\nOpen data are the foundation of ESDS efforts to fulfill the program’s vision of accelerating scientific advancement for societal benefit through innovative Earth science data stewardship and technology development….to leverage the diversity of global Earth science communities to advance open science.\n\nOpenscapes’ long-term goal is to enable robust, inclusive, and enduring science- and data-driven solutions to global and time-sensitive challenges. We approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. We see data analysis and stewardship as entryways to meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skill sets and mindsets while empowering them as leaders. With NASA support, the project team and the partners, the Openscapes Framework fundamentally changes the paradigm for supporting research teams and DAAC mentors, first to work more openly with their teams on the cloud, and ultimately to advance open science!\nOpenscapes is co-directed by project leads Lowndes and Robinson, and operated at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), University of California Santa Barbara."

Openscapes is joining The Carpentries through this project as a Silver Member, which includes four Carpentries workshops per year and instructor training opportunities to the NASA DAAC community.\n2i2c develops, deploys, customizes, and manages open source tools and cloud services for interactive computing in research and education. They deploy community-driven infrastructure, inspired by use-cases such as the UC Berkeley DataHubs and the Pangeo project, that provides easy “one-click-to-cloud” access with Jupyter Notebooks through the web browser designed to reduce the startup burden for new learners, and this approach will also benefit the NASA DAAC community."
