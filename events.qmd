**December 12 2021. AGU Fall Meeting Workshop (Virtual)** \
NASA's Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program promotes open data access for open science. The workshop will highlight novel applications that utilize EOSDIS data in the cloud. Participants will leave having a better understanding of how NASA Earthdata Cloud data and services can best be leveraged and integrated within their work across a variety of disciplines and data types. Details: <https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Session/124026>; <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Workshop-AGU/> <br>

**November 15-19 2021. Cross-DAAC Cloud Hackathon** \
The NASA-Openscapes Framework is part of a collaborative Cross-DAAC hackathon to help transition workflows to the cloud. All details and tutorials are available at: <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/><br>

**March 2021 - Feb 2021. Openscapes Champions Mentors: DAAC Cohort**\
We are supporting and strengthening the community of DAAC folks that are already creating cloud learning resources. Through Openscapes mentorship, Carpentries instructor training, and 2i2c cloud services, these DAAC mentors will work together to create learning resources for their teams and communities. <br>

**Feb 2021. Openscapes and Collaborators Announce Openscapes NASA Project** \
We are thrilled to announce that NASA awarded Openscapes and partners a 3-year project to utilize the Openscapes Framework and support researchers using NASA Earthdata as it moves to the cloud. [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2021/03/10/nasa-announcement/) and it's host institution, [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/nasa-openscapes), [Metadata Game Changers](https://metadatagamechangers.com/blog/2021/3/10/metadata-game-changers-partners-with-openscapes-in-new-nasa-funded-project) and [NASA's Earthdata Blog](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/openscapes) all shared posts about the award.
