## Openscapes

Openscapes champions open, inclusive practices in environmental and Earth science to help uncover data-intensive solutions faster. We do this through our flagship Champions mentorship program, as well as through community organizing, training, and coaching, leveraging existing resources from open communities along with our own. 

Our [flywheel](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html) shows our approach to engaging, empowering, and amplifying research communities in open data science — how we describe kinder, better science in less time.

## The NASA-Openscapes project

**The overarching vision** is to support scientific researchers using NASA data as they migrate their workflows to the cloud. We are doing this working with NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) over three years by:

1.  Developing a cross-DAAC Mentor community that supports growth into confident cloud data instructors, and create, curate and use shared resources and have a tutorial review process

2.  Empowering science teams to experiment migrating their download-intensive data analysis workflows to the cloud through a partnership with Carpentries and 2i2c

3.  Scaling the Openscapes Champions program with DAAC Mentors to support science cohorts and amplify as many open science leaders as possible, transforming their workflows towards open, kinder science and the cloud

## Timeline

This is the timeline for Year 1, which we will repeat in Years 2 and 3 as Mentors increasingly lead science cohorts at their own DAACs.

## Partners

This project allows us to partner with organizations that share Openscapes’ values of open, reproducible, and inclusive science: 

- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. Openscapes is joining The Carpentries through this project as a Silver Member, which includes four Carpentries workshops per year and instructor training opportunities to the NASA DAAC community. 
- [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/) develops, deploys, customizes, and manages open source tools and cloud services for interactive computing in research and education. They deploy community-driven infrastructure, inspired by use-cases such as the UC Berkeley DataHubs and the Pangeo project, that provides easy “one-click-to-cloud” access with Jupyter Notebooks through the web browser designed to reduce the startup burden for new learners, and this approach will also benefit the NASA DAAC community.
