## The project

**The overarching vision** is to support scientific researchers using NASA data as they migrate their workflows to the cloud. We are doing this working with NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) over three years by:

1.  Developing a cross-DAAC Mentor community that supports growth into confident cloud data instructors, and create, curate and use shared resources and have a tutorial review process   

2.  Scaling the Openscapes Champions science cohorts with DAAC Mentors to reach and support as many research teams as possible, transforming their workflows towards open, kinder science and the cloud

3.  Empowering researchers to experiment migrating their download-intensive data analysis workflows to the cloud through a partnership with Carpentries and 2i2c

Here is the plan for Year 1, which we will repeat in Years 2 and 3 as Year-1 Mentors increasingly lead research team Cohorts at their own DAACs.
