We do this through our flagship Champions mentorship program, as well as through community organizing, training, and coaching, leveraging existing resources from open communities along with our own.\nOur flywheel shows our approach to engaging, empowering, and amplifying research communities in open data science — how we describe kinder, better science in less time.\nOpenscapes flywheel shows 6 points around a hexagon: Develop, Invest, Attract, Deliver, Transform, InspireThe NASA EarthData-Openscapes project\nThe overarching vision is to support scientific researchers using NASA Earthdata as they migrate their workflows to the cloud. We are doing this working with NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) over three years by:\nDeveloping a cross-DAAC Mentor community that supports growth into confident cloud data instructors, and create, curate and use shared resources and have a tutorial review process\nEmpowering science teams to experiment migrating their download-intensive data analysis workflows to the cloud through a partnership with Carpentries and 2i2c\nScaling the Openscapes Champions program with DAAC Mentors to support science cohorts and amplify as many open science leaders as possible, transforming their workflows towards open, kinder science and the cloud\nSlides\nOpenscapes - July 6, 2021: SAFe Plenary by Amy Steiker\nBetter Science for Future Us - June 30, 2021: Pangeo Showcase\nNASA DAACs Openscapes Framework - March 25, 2021: NASA ESDS-ESDIS-DAACs-IMPACT Meeting\n\nWhy NASA Earthdata? Why Openscapes?\nWe are getting these questions a lot, so here is our take.\nNASA Earth Science Data Systems missions collect Earth data, including sea ice, physical oceanography, vegetation and many other parameters – data used by researchers around the world for many different purposes, including answering pressing questions in ecology and environmental science. Further, NASA promotes open science – from the NASA Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program 2020 Highlights report:\n\nOpen data are the foundation of ESDS efforts to fulfill the program’s vision of accelerating scientific advancement for societal benefit through innovative Earth science data stewardship and technology development…. [This includes a specific goal] to leverage the diversity of global Earth science communities to advance open science.\n\nOpenscapes’ long-term goal is to enable robust, inclusive, and enduring science- and data-driven solutions to global and time-sensitive challenges. We approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. We see data analysis and stewardship as entryways to meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skill sets and mindsets while empowering them as leaders. With NASA support, the project team and the partners, the Openscapes Framework fundamentally changes the paradigm for supporting research teams and DAAC mentors, first to work more openly with their teams on the cloud, and ultimately to advance open science!\nOpenscapes is co-directed by project leads Lowndes and Robinson, and operated at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), University of California Santa Barbara.\nProject Leads\nJulia Stewart Lowndes, PhD\nNational Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)\nUniversity of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)lowndes at nceas.ucsb.edu; @juliesquid\n\nErin Robinson, MSc\nMetadata Game Changerserin@metadatagamechangers.com; @connector_erin\nProject Teams\nNASA-Openscapes Mentors are a cross-DAAC Mentor community that is co-creating common tutorials, resources, and teaching approaches to support researchers migrating worksflows to the Cloud.\nLearn more about the NASA-Openscapes Champions — coming soon.\nPartners\nThis project allows us to partner with organizations that share Openscapes’ values of open, reproducible, and inclusive science:\nThe Carpentries teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. Openscapes is joining The Carpentries through this project as a Silver Member, which includes four Carpentries workshops per year and instructor training opportunities to the NASA DAAC community.\n2i2c develops, deploys, customizes, and manages open source tools and cloud services for interactive computing in research and education. They deploy community-driven infrastructure, inspired by use-cases such as the UC Berkeley DataHubs and the Pangeo project, that provides easy “one-click-to-cloud” access with Jupyter Notebooks through the web browser designed to reduce the startup burden for new learners, and this approach will also benefit the NASA DAAC community.\nLearn More\nearthdata.nasa.gov\nopenscapes.org\n\n\n\n",

We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science2, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\nOpenscapes Champions is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata, cloud), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.\nNASA Openscapes is a 3-year project to support scientists using data from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud. As part of this work, we will offer the Openscapes Champions program several times from 2022-2024.\n\n\nChampions Program Details\nThank you so much for your interest in the Openscapes Champions Cohort. We’ve decided to delay this cohort until early 2022 to better align with NASA cloud migration. Please check back here in late 2021 as we announce rescheduled Champions dates.\n\nnature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160↩︎\nblogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/open-software-means-kinder-science\n\n↩︎\n",
