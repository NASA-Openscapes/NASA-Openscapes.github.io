Why\nOpenscapes?\nWe are getting these questions a lot, so here is our take.\nNASA Earth Science Data Systems missions collect Earth data,\nincluding sea ice, physical oceanography, vegetation and many other\nparameters – data used by researchers around the world for many\ndifferent purposes, including answering pressing questions in ecology\nand environmental science. Further, NASA promotes open science – from\nthe NASA Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program 2020 Highlights\nreport:\n\nOpen data are the foundation of ESDS efforts to fulfill the program’s\nvision of accelerating scientific advancement for societal benefit\nthrough innovative Earth science data stewardship and technology\ndevelopment….to leverage the diversity of global Earth science\ncommunities to advance open science.\n\nOpenscapes’ long-term goal is to enable robust, inclusive, and\nenduring science- and data-driven solutions to global and time-sensitive\nchallenges. We approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior\nchange, and as a movement. We see data analysis and stewardship as\nentryways to meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new\nskill sets and mindsets while empowering them as leaders. With NASA\nsupport, the project team and the partners, the Openscapes Framework\nfundamentally changes the paradigm for supporting research teams and\nDAAC mentors, first to work more openly with their teams on the cloud,\nand ultimately to advance open science!\nOpenscapes is co-directed by project leads Lowndes and Robinson, and\noperated at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis\n(NCEAS), University of California Santa Barbara.\nProject Leads\nJulia Stewart Lowndes, PhD\nNational Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)\nUniversity of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)lowndes at\nnceas.ucsb.edu; @juliesquid\n\nErin Robinson, MSc\nMetadata Game Changers, LLC\nUniversity of Colorado, Bouldererin@metadatagamechangers.com;\n@connector_erin\nProject Teams\nNASA-Openscapes\nMentors are a cross-DAAC Mentor community that is co-creating common\ntutorials, resources, and teaching approaches to support researchers\nmigrating worksflows to the Cloud.\nLearn more about the NASA-Openscapes Champions — coming soon.\nPartners\nThis project allows us to partner with organizations that share\nOpenscapes’ values of open, reproducible, and inclusive science:\nThe Carpentries teach\nfoundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.\nOpenscapes is joining The Carpentries through this project as a Silver\nMember, which includes four Carpentries workshops per year and\ninstructor training opportunities to the NASA DAAC community.\n2i2c develops, deploys, customizes,\nand manages open source tools and cloud services for interactive\ncomputing in research and education. They deploy community-driven\ninfrastructure, inspired by use-cases such as the UC Berkeley DataHubs\nand the Pangeo project, that provides easy “one-click-to-cloud” access\nwith Jupyter Notebooks through the web browser designed to reduce the\nstartup burden for new learners, and this approach will also benefit the\nNASA DAAC community.\nLearn More\nearthdata.nasa.gov\nopenscapes.org\n\n\n\n",

We\nhelp research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that\nare of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and\ninclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community\nengagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science2, enabling increased efficiency and\nresilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\nOpenscapes\nChampions is a remote-by-design mentorship program for\nenvironmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data\nscience practices. Participants attend as a team with their research\ngroup in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe\ndata-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open\nsoftware tooling and communities enabling reproducible research\n(e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata, cloud), participants develop\ncollaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared\npractices for increased efficiency in their own research, while\ncontributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.\nNASA\nOpenscapes is a 3-year project to support scientists using\ndata from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System\n(EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate\nworkflows to the cloud. As part of this work, we will offer the\nOpenscapes Champions program several times from 2022-2024.\n\n\nChampions Program Details\nThe Openscapes Champions Cohort will run from March-April 2022. We\nwill meet as a cohort five times over two months, on alternating\nFridays. Additional hands-on Clinics will be scheduled within this\nperiod.\nDates: March 4, 18, April 1, 15, 29\nTimes: 10:00-11:30 am Pacific Time\nWhere: remotely, via Zoom\nWho: Cohort of 7 research groups that work with\ndata from NASA DAACs. Each team consists of a team lead (faculty,\nprincipal investigator, etc) and up to 4 team members of your choice\n(graduate students, post docs, research techs, etc).\nCost: Free; this opportunity is supported by NASA\nthrough a grant to Openscapes\nExpected time commitment: 8hrs/month for 2 months\nis a minimum expected time commitment. This accounts for 3 hours/month\nof synchronous Zoom calls, Clinics, and collaborating with your research\ngroup to strengthen shared workflows.\nNominate your team to\nparticipate\nNominate your team by completing this\nGoogle Form by February 4, 2022. This opportunity is open\nonly to research groups that work with data from NASA DAACs. Priority\nwill be given to researchers using data from DAACs participating in\nOpenscapes this year: LP DAAC, NSIDC, PO.DAAC, GES DISC, and ASDC.\nPlease submit one nomination per team, preferably by the team lead\n(faculty, principal investigator, etc). We will confirm participation in\nearly February 2022.\nLearn more about the Openscapes Champions\nProgram, stories from\nprevious cohorts, and FAQs\nabout forming your team. Questions?

In his role,\nAaron provides user needs insights and technical support for archive and\ndistribution, service development, and outreach activities. He develops\ntutorials, scripts, and presentations that highlight the use of land\nremote sensing data in analysis workflows. More recently, his work has\nfocused on advocating for the uptake of cloud computing in the land\nremote sensing community.\nShubhankar Gahlot\nIksha Gurung\nAlexis Hunzinger\nAlexis\nHunzinger is a Support Scientist at the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences\nData and Information Services Center (GES DISC), focused on addressing\nthe needs of the user community. Alexis works closely with the GES DISC\nUser Working Group, fielding concerns and suggestions to be implemented\nat the DAAC. She also leads the effort at GES DISC of developing guides,\ntutorials, and other resources designed to educate and welcome users to\nthe Earthdata Cloud.\nLuis Lopez\nCatalina Oaida\nCatalina\nM. Oaida, PhD is an Applied Science System Engineer at\nNASA’s JPL (and PO.DAAC), combining hydrology and Earth science domain\nexpertise (science researcher by training) with a system engineering\nperspective. Focus on broadening the user base for NASA Earth\nobservations and remote sensing data in the Cloud, and helping increase\ndiscoverability, accessibility and usability of these data for the\nscience research and applications communities, and enabling shorter\n“time to science”. Reducing those barriers to science when data and\nservices are in the cloud, while recognizing that there is a great\ndiversity in user needs, experiences, domain expertise, access to\nresources - create and implement a comprehensive plan to ensure as many\nof these user ‘types’ are supported. Develop science use cases as\ntraining examples, leveraging open data and open science (and tools).\nLearning from others and co-creating.\nJack McNelis\nJack McNelis is a Science Applications Software Engineer at NASA Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (and the PO.DAAC) with experience leveraging EOS\ndata for rangeland ecosystem monitoring applications.
