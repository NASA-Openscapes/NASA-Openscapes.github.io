We are doing this working with NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) over three years by:\nDeveloping a cross-DAAC Mentor community that supports growth into confident cloud data instructors, and create, curate and use shared resources and have a tutorial review process   \nScaling the Openscapes Champions science cohorts with DAAC Mentors to reach and support as many research teams as possible, transforming their workflows towards open, kinder science and the cloud\nEmpowering researchers to experiment migrating their download-intensive data analysis workflows to the cloud through a partnership with Carpentries and 2i2c\nLearn more in this blog post announcement.\nTimeline\nHere is the timeline for Year 1, which we will repeat in Years 2 and 3 as Year-1 Mentors increasingly lead research team Cohorts at their own DAACs.\nGantt Chart for Year 1, January to December with 3 task headers: Engage DAAC Mentor Teams, Empower Science Teams, Amplify LeadersProject Leads\nJulia Stewart Lowndes, PhD\nNational Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) \nUniversity of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)\nlowndes at nceas.ucsb.edu; @juliesquid\n\nErin Robinson, MSc\nMetadata Game Changers\nerin@metadatagamechangers.com; @connector_erin\n\nAmanda Tan, PhD\neScience Institute\nUniversity of Washington\namandach@uw.edu\n\nLearn More\nearthdata.nasa.gov\nopenscapes.org\n\n\n\n",

Openscapes Champions Mentors: DAAC Cohort\nWe are supporting and strengthening the community of DAAC folks that are already creating cloud learning resources. Through Openscapes mentorship, Carpentries instructor training, and 2i2c cloud services, these DAAC mentors will work together to create learning resources for their teams and communities.\n\n\n\n",

April 1, 2021: We heard about each other’s work more and start discussing creating cloud tutorials and thinking about next steps\nResources:\nPathways Template\n\n3. April 15, 2021: We discussed how the group would like to work together to create teaching materials, and discussed a teaching model for future sessions\n4.
