We do this through our flagship Champions mentorship program, as well as through community organizing, training, and coaching, leveraging existing resources from open communities along with our own.\nOur flywheel shows our approach to engaging, empowering, and amplifying research communities in open data science — how we describe kinder, better science in less time.\nOpenscapes flywheel shows 6 points around a hexagon: Develop, Invest, Attract, Deliver, Transform, InspireThe NASA-Openscapes project\nThe overarching vision is to support scientific researchers using NASA data as they migrate their workflows to the cloud. We are doing this working with NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) over three years by:\nDeveloping a cross-DAAC Mentor community that supports growth into confident cloud data instructors, and create, curate and use shared resources and have a tutorial review process\nEmpowering science teams to experiment migrating their download-intensive data analysis workflows to the cloud through a partnership with Carpentries and 2i2c\nScaling the Openscapes Champions program with DAAC Mentors to support science cohorts and amplify as many open science leaders as possible, transforming their workflows towards open, kinder science and the cloud\nTimeline\nThis is the timeline for Year 1, which we will repeat in Years 2 and 3 as Mentors increasingly lead science cohorts at their own DAACs.\nGantt Chart for Year 1, January to December with 3 task headers: Engage DAAC Mentor Teams, Empower Science Teams, Amplify LeadersSlides\nNASA DAACs Openscapes Framework - March 25, 2021: NASA ESDS-ESDIS-DAACs-IMPACT Meeting\n\nProject Leads\nJulia Stewart Lowndes, PhD\nNational Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) \nUniversity of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)\nlowndes at nceas.ucsb.edu; @juliesquid\n\nErin Robinson, MSc\nMetadata Game Changers\nerin@metadatagamechangers.com; @connector_erin\n\nAmanda Tan, PhD\neScience Institute\nUniversity of Washington\namandach@uw.edu\nPartners\nThis project allows us to partner with organizations that share Openscapes’ values of open, reproducible, and inclusive science:\nThe Carpentries teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. Openscapes is joining The Carpentries through this project as a Silver Member, which includes four Carpentries workshops per year and instructor training opportunities to the NASA DAAC community.\n2i2c develops, deploys, customizes, and manages open source tools and cloud services for interactive computing in research and education. They deploy community-driven infrastructure, inspired by use-cases such as the UC Berkeley DataHubs and the Pangeo project, that provides easy “one-click-to-cloud” access with Jupyter Notebooks through the web browser designed to reduce the startup burden for new learners, and this approach will also benefit the NASA DAAC community.\nLearn More\nearthdata.nasa.gov\nopenscapes.org\n\n\n\n",

He is interested in improving access to geospatial data for diverse user communities. Cole supports missions archived and distributed by the LP DAAC including MODIS, VIIRS, ASTER, ECOSTRESS, and GEDI by creating Python tutorials and data prep scripts and providing workshops and webinars to facilitate community uptake and understanding of those missions.\nAaron Friesz\nAaron Friesz is the Science Coordination Lead at NASA’s Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). In his role, Aaron provides user needs insights and technical support for archive and distribution, service development, and outreach activities. He develops tutorials, scripts, and presentations that highlight the use of land remote sensing data in analysis workflows. More recently, his work has focused on advocating for the uptake of cloud computing in the land remote sensing community.\nCatalina Oaida\nCatalina M. Oaida, PhD is an Applied Science System Engineer at NASA’s JPL (and PO.DAAC), combining hydrology and Earth science domain expertise (science researcher by training) with a system engineering perspective. Focus on broadening the user base for NASA Earth observations and remote sensing data in the Cloud, and helping increase discoverability, accessibility and usability of these data for the science research and applications communities, and enabling shorter “time to science”. Reducing those barriers to science when data and services are in the cloud, while recognizing that there is a great diversity in user needs, experiences, domain expertise, access to resources - create and implement a comprehensive plan to ensure as many of these user ‘types’ are supported. Develop science use cases as training examples, leveraging open data and open science (and tools). Learning from others and co-creating.\nJack McNelis\nJack McNelis is a Science Applications Software Engineer at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (and the PO.DAAC) with experience leveraging EOS data for rangeland ecosystem monitoring applications. He develops and curates metadata to describe PO.DAAC data holdings, and to better integrate them with data delivery services and end user softwares. He also develops resources for users to be better prepared to implement their analyses in the cloud.\nMakhan Virdi\nMakhan Virdi is the ASDC DAAC Scientist, experienced in creating geospatial tools and services for science-based analysis, visualization (UI/UX), discovery and distribution of data generated by field/laboratory observations, remote sensing, and model simulation. He is interested in AI/ML for earth science data, multi-sensor data fusion, and data analytics in the cloud. He is excited to be part of the Openscapes community, and is looking forward to learning from peers, and sharing his knowledge and skills with the community to develop and promote data science techniques, best practices, and inter-agency collaborations.\nMatt Tisdale\nMatt Tisdale is a data scientist working at the NASA Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC). He is interested in improving access to ASDC satellite and airborne data products. He uses ArcGIS, OPeNDAP, Python, and Jupyter notebooks to show users how to obtain and analyze data from ASDC. I am interested in learning more cloud analysis techniques to share with our user base as more and more of our ASDC data products are migrated to the cloud.\nVishal Bagadia\nVishal Bagadia is a data science analyst working on contract at the Atmospheric Science Data Center DAAC, NASA Langley Research Center. His experience in exploring emissions retrievals from satellite missions and guiding science teams during the development of their research products powers his work on addressing data interoperability concerns and being responsive to user’s engagement with the archived data. He is energized in leveraging emerging, free, and open-source technologies to better represent and visualize large datasets, building web applications to meet user’s data transformation and accessibility needs, and ultimately producing sustainable solutions to meet end-user requirements as data moves into the cloud.\nAmy Steiker\nAmy Steiker is the NSIDC DAAC Data Services Engineer, specializing in the development and management of data education resources, tools, and services for NSIDC DAAC’s growing user community, as well as data transformation service development for NASA EOSDIS. She is excited to join this first Openscapes cohort to work together with our science communities to develop and sustain tooling that supports their data processing workflows as they transition to the Earthdata Cloud.\nPaul Moth\nPaul Moth is a Data Support Specialist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (NSIDC DAAC). He is part of the User Services team and currently represents MODIS, VIIRS, SMAP, High Mountain Asia, and Nimbus missions at NSIDC DAAC. He is interested in working with early adopters and science team members and gathering feedback that identifies the key operations/steps/workflows that would be most important for creating tutorials and educational materials.\n\n\n\n",
