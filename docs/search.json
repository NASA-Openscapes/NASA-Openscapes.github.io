We do this through mentorship, coaching, training, and community organizing, leveraging existing resources from open communities along with our own.\nOur flywheel shows our approach to engaging, empowering, and amplifying research communities in open data science. The flywheel is a concept by Jim Collins.\nOpenscapes flywheel shows 6 points around a hexagon: Develop, Invest, Attract, Deliver, Transform, InspireThe NASA-Openscapes project\nThe overarching vision is to support scientific researchers using NASA data as they migrate their workflows to the cloud. We are doing this working with NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) over three years by:\nDeveloping a cross-DAAC Mentor community that supports growth into confident cloud data instructors, and create, curate and use shared resources and have a tutorial review process\nEmpowering science teams to experiment migrating their download-intensive data analysis workflows to the cloud through a partnership with Carpentries and 2i2c\nScaling the Openscapes Champions science cohorts with DAAC Mentors to support and amplify as many open science leaders as possible, transforming their workflows towards open, kinder science and the cloud\nTimeline\nThis is the timeline for Year 1, which we will repeat in Years 2 and 3 as Mentors increasingly lead science cohorts at their own DAACs.\nGantt Chart for Year 1, January to December with 3 task headers: Engage DAAC Mentor Teams, Empower Science Teams, Amplify LeadersSlides\nNASA DAACs Openscapes Framework - March 25, 2021: NASA ESDS-ESDIS-DAACs-IMPACT Meeting\n\nProject Leads\nJulia Stewart Lowndes, PhD\nNational Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) \nUniversity of California Santa Barbara (UCSB)\nlowndes at nceas.ucsb.edu; @juliesquid\n\nErin Robinson, MSc\nMetadata Game Changers\nerin@metadatagamechangers.com; @connector_erin\n\nAmanda Tan, PhD\neScience Institute\nUniversity of Washington\namandach@uw.edu\n\nLearn More\nearthdata.nasa.gov\nopenscapes.org\n\n\n\n",
