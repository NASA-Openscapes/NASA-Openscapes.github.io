## Overview

**[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org)** is an approach for doing better science in less time[^1]. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science[^2], enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.

**[Openscapes Champions](https://openscapes.org/champions)** is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata, cloud), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.

**[NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io)** is a 3-year project to support scientists using data from NASA’s Earth Observation System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud. As part of this work, we will offer the Openscapes Champions program annually from 2021-2024.

## Champions Program Details

The NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort will run from August - November 2021. We will meet as a cohort twice monthly over four months, on alternating Fridays.

*   **Dates:** August 13 & 27, September 10 & 24, October 8 & 22, November 5 & 19
*   **Times:** 10:00-11:30 am Pacific Time
*   **Where:** remotely, via Zoom
*   **Who: **Cohort of 6-8 research groups that work with data from NASA DAACs. Each team consists of a team lead (faculty, principal investigator, etc) and up to 4 team members of your choice (graduate students, undergraduates, technicians, etc). 
*   **Expected time commitment:** 5hrs/month for 4 months, which accounts for a 3 hours/month of synchronous Zoom calls, and the remaining time for collaborating with your research group in between calls.

## Nominate your team to participate

Nominate your team by completing **[this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWC8W0f1URDHV2KdPE6a53AH18FimdlOgFBhaDDhiNHJ6sMA/viewform?usp=sf_link) by June 25, 2021**. This opportunity is open only to research groups that work with data from NASA DAACs. Priority will be given to researchers using data from DAACs participating in Openscapes this year: LP DAAC, NSIDC, PO.DAAC, GES DISC, and ASDC.

Please submit one nomination per team, preferably by the team lead (faculty, principal investigator, etc). We will confirm participation by mid July 2021.
