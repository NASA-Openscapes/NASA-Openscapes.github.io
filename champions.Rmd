## Overview

**[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org)** is an approach for doing better science in less time[^1]. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science[^2], enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.

**[Openscapes Champions](https://openscapes.org/champions)** is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata, cloud), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.

**[NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io)** is a 3-year project to support scientists using data from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud. As part of this work, we will offer the Openscapes Champions program several times from 2022-2024.

## Champions Program Details

Thank you so much for your interest in the Openscapes Champions Cohort.  We’ve decided to delay this cohort until early 2022 to better align with NASA cloud migration. Please check back here in late 2021 as we announce rescheduled Champions dates.


<!---

The NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort will run from March-April 2022. We will meet as a cohort twice monthly over four months, on alternating Fridays. Additional hands-on Clinics will be scheduled with participants.

*   **Dates:** March 4, 18, April 1, 15, 29
*   **Times:** 10:00-11:30 am Pacific Time
*   **Where:** remotely, via Zoom
*   **Who: **Cohort of 6-8 research groups that work with data from NASA DAACs. Each team consists of a team lead (faculty, principal investigator, etc) and up to 4 team members of your choice (graduate students, post docs, research technicians, etc). 
*   **Cost:** Free; this opportunity is supported by NASA through a grant to Openscapes 
*   **Expected time commitment:** 8hrs/month for 2 months, which accounts for a 3 hours/month of synchronous Zoom calls, Clinic time, and collaborating with your research group to strengthen shared workflows.

## Nominate your team to participate

Nominate your team by completing **[this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScz-0XUEw-RFCyzn3LNXl_8sDGIxIjY4Agy-esWjnSvOk_Jlw/viewform?usp=sf_link) by February 1, 2022**. This opportunity is open only to research groups that work with data from NASA DAACs. Priority will be given to researchers using data from DAACs participating in Openscapes this year: LP DAAC, NSIDC, PO.DAAC, GES DISC, and ASDC.

Please submit one nomination per team, preferably by the team lead (faculty, principal investigator, etc). We will confirm participation in early February 2022.
