## Overview

**[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org)** is an approach for doing better science in less time[^1]. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science[^2], enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.

**[Openscapes Champions](https://openscapes.org/champions)** is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata, cloud), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.

**[NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io)** is a 3-year project to support scientists using data from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud. As part of this work, we will offer the Openscapes Champions program several times from 2022-2024.

## Champions Program Details

Thank you so much for your interest in the Openscapes Champions Cohort.  We’ve decided to delay this cohort until early 2022 to better align with NASA cloud migration. Please check back here in late 2021 as we announce rescheduled Champions dates.


<!---

The NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort will run from August - November 2021. We will meet as a cohort twice monthly over four months, on alternating Thursdays.

*   **Dates:** August 12 & 26, September 9 & 23, October 7 & 21, November 4 & 18
*   **Times:** 10:00-11:30 am Pacific Time
*   **Where:** remotely, via Zoom
*   **Who: **Cohort of 6-8 research groups that work with data from NASA DAACs. Each team consists of a team lead (faculty, principal investigator, etc) and up to 4 team members of your choice (graduate students, post docs, research technicians, etc). 
*   **Cost:** Free; this opportunity is supported by NASA through a grant to Openscapes at the University of California Santa Barbara
*   **Expected time commitment:** 5hrs/month for 4 months, which accounts for a 3 hours/month of synchronous Zoom calls, and the remaining time for collaborating with your research group in between calls.

## Nominate your team to participate

Nominate your team by completing **[this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWC8W0f1URDHV2KdPE6a53AH18FimdlOgFBhaDDhiNHJ6sMA/viewform?usp=sf_link) by June 25, 2021**. This opportunity is open only to research groups that work with data from NASA DAACs. Priority will be given to researchers using data from DAACs participating in Openscapes this year: LP DAAC, NSIDC, PO.DAAC, GES DISC, and ASDC.

Please submit one nomination per team, preferably by the team lead (faculty, principal investigator, etc). We will confirm participation by mid July 2021.

## Frequently Asked Questions

In addition to the [FAQs about forming your team](https://openscapes.org/faq), here are a few FAQs for this NASA Champions Cohort: 

### Are we a good fit?

The Openscapes Science Champions is meant to build on short cloud workshops when people say "OK, now I want to do that with my data..."  Our hope was that teams we select will be working with NASA data that is already in the cloud (or will be on the cloud this early this fall). We want these teams to be supported in making the transition to the cloud and to actually change the way they work, not only learn skills. By November, we'd like the teams to be applying this to their work daily. 

### Can my whole research group participate?

We are looking for a max of 5 people per team, including the team lead. This will likely be a subset of a whole research group. In the weeks between each Cohort Call, we ask that the teams meet together to have a '[seaside chat](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/03/10/seaside-chats/)' with their whole research group, where they talk about their data issues, what they are learning and how they are moving forward along their pathway towards making this transition.
